It was published by Taito in North America and Japan, and by Titus in Europe. It is a follow-up to Taito's 1987 arcade game of the same name, and shares similar gameplay. The player can choose between playing as one of three robotic ninjas, and is tasked with helping a rebel faction overthrow an oppressive dictatorship. Each character has different attributes and a unique set of moves including jumps, dashes, throws, and other attacks. The game was developed by the same team at Natsume that later developed Wild Guns (1994).\r\nThe game was generally well received by critics. They compared the quality of The Ninja Warriors to Neo Geo and arcade games, and the tight controls and vibrant graphics were universally praised. Journalists disagreed on the quality of several aspects including the difficulty, sound quality, and how well the game distinguished itself among the myriad of beat 'em up games.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>忍者战士</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/14822\">ナツメ</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/7482\">Taito</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>The Ninja Warriors</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>The Ninja Warriors Again</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>The Ninja Warriors: Once Again</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>The Ninja Saviors: Return of the Warriors</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Beat 'em up</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年1月28日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"BeatUp","count":1},{"name":"PS4","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":14822,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/e3/34/14822_prsn_a4Pye.jpg","name":"Natsume","desc":"开发"},{"id":7482,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/54/d7/7482_prsn_Ad23D.jpg","name":"太东","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":305485,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/fa/21/305485_9JdMf.jpg","title":"ニンジャウォーリアーズ","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/305485"}]}
