It is the third game in the Goemon series released in North America and Europe, following Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon, released two years earlier. Featuring platform gameplay in 2.5D, it marked the return of the series to a side-scrolling format.\r\nThe quirky story highlights Goemon's quest to stop the evil Bismaru, who has stolen Wise Man's resurrection machine. Goemon and his friends must journey through five worlds to battle the revived Dochuki, prince of the underworld, and destroy the captured device. Each world is designed with Japanese styles and themes, and Goemon's Great Adventure continues the series' tradition of offbeat, surreal humor.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>大盗五右卫门2 道中除妖记</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>大盗五佑卫门2 道中除妖记</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Goemon's Great Adventure</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Mystical Ninja 2 Starring Goemon</li><li><span>平台: </span>N64</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT (2D Platform)</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1998年12月23日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":747,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/c1/747_prsn_43cah.jpg","name":"科乐美","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":240500,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b8/22/240500_9yUlx.jpg","title":"がんばれゴエモン〜ネオ桃山幕府のおどり〜","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/240500"}]}
