{"id":305627,"type":4,"name":"The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0d/78/305627_VnN2V.jpg","summary":"The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age is a loose adaptation of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film trilogy; The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). As it is not an adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 novel The Lord of the Rings, anything from the novels not specifically mentioned or depicted in the films could not be represented in the game.\r\n\r\nThe Third Age is an RPG in the style of the games in the Final Fantasy series. The game's turn-based combat system is similar to Final Fantasy X's \"Conditional Turn-Based\" system (CTB), which replaced the \"Active Time Battle\" system (ATB) used from Final Fantasy IV to Final Fantasy IX. \r\n\r\nAlthough the main narrative of the game runs parallel to the narrative in the film trilogy, the plot is not intended as an original canonical story to fit into the plot as developed in the films. This is primarily seen insofar as the party are present during certain battles which in the films are solo fights, such as when Gandalf faces the Balrog in The Fellowship of the Ring or when Éowyn faces the Witch-king of Angmar in The Return of the King. The game also features events which don't take place in the films at all; such as a battle between the party and Gríma Wormtongue in Snowbourne, and another against the Eye of Sauron atop Barad-dûr. Throughout the game, Gandalf 'speaks' to Berethor by means of \"Epic Scenes\"; film clips which the player can collect and which feature original narration by Gandalf. These clips give context to much of the plot and serve to offer advice to Berethor of events in the wider world.\r\n\r\n简介节选自英文维基百科。","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>指环王：第三纪元</li><li><span>开发: </span>EA Redwood Shores (现<a href=\"/person/32574\">Visceral Games</a>)</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人，1~3人 (合作模式)</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2004年11月2日</li><li><span>其他发行日期: </span>2004年11月5日 (PS2 欧洲)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">其他发行日期: </span>2004年11月12日 (GC 欧洲)</li><li><span>监制: </span>Steve Gray</li><li><span>制作人: </span>Todd Arnold、Billy Delligatti、Steve Papoutsis、John Salera</li><li><span>导演: </span>Eric Vaughn</li><li><span>项目经理: </span>Audrey Thayer Gustafon</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Christoper A.
