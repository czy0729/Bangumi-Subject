Following his wife and baby's death in childbirth Jem goes to Manchester for better work prospects and Mary moves to London to pursue her writing career.

Mrs. Jamieson's widowed sister-in-law Lady Glenmire arrives in Cranford and, to her snooty relative's annoyance, is charmingly down-to-earth, captivating everyone, notably Captain Brown, whom she marries after a whirlwind courtship.
