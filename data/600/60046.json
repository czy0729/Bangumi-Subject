The truth-telling, hard-living scribe struggles to balance his new life as the Big Man on Campus, while raising a rebellious daughter to \"do as I say, not as I do.\"\r\n\r\nFamed novelist & NYC transplant Hank relocated to LA after his acclaimed book was optioned, only to be disappointed when it later becomes a crappy romantic comedy. Since then, he's struggled to get his career back on track and raise his young daughter, all while pining for his ex-girlfriend. It may sound desperate, but he enjoys life and owns all his various vices — drink, drugs and women — with a refreshing sense of honesty and unapologetic candor. He's holding it together while falling apart, and he doesn't mind it one bit.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>加州靡情 第四季</li><li><span>配角: </span><a href=\"/person/36023\">Josh Gad</a></li><li><span>集数: </span>12</li><li><span>开始: </span>2011-01-09</li><li><span>结束: </span>2011-03-27</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>频道: </span>Showtime</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.sho.com/sho/californication/home</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0904208</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"eps":[{"id":227350,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/227350","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":227351,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/227351","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":227352,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/227352","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":227353,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/227353","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":227354,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/227354","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":227355,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/227355","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":227356,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/227356","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":227357,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/227357","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":227358,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/227358","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":227359,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/227359","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":227360,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/227360","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":227361,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/227361","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":36023,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5f/65/36023_prsn_s845s.jpg","name":"乔什·加德","desc":"配角"}],"relations":[{"id":60026,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ad/d4/60026_6u0Ip.jpg","title":"Californication (Season 3)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/60026"},{"id":28544,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d4/c4/28544_YCAd0.jpg","title":"Californication (Season 5)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/28544"}]}
