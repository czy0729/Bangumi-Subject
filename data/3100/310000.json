It was written by Howard Delman who previously programmed Super Bug for Atari.\r\n\r\nThe player and an opponent fly a blimp or biplane over a canyon full of numbered, circular rocks, arranged in layers. The player does not control the flight of vehicles, but only presses a single button to drop a bomb which destroys rocks and gives points. Each rock is labeled with the points given for destroying it. As the number of rocks is reduced, it becomes harder to hit them without missing. The third time a player drops a bomb without hitting a rock, the game is over.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>街机</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1977年11月</li><li><span>其他发行日期: </span>1978年秋 (Atari 2600)</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Howard Delman</li><li><span>程序: </span>Howard Delman, David Crane</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
