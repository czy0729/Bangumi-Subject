The series reached its greatest heights with the Judas Contract storyline—a multipart epic that played on comics readers’ expectations and offered shocking revelations and surprising twists at every turn. From the retirement of Robin and Kid Flash, to the birth of Nightwing and the introduction of Jericho, to the ultimate betrayal of a Titan, “The Judas Contract” kept readers positively riveted during its initial run, and still has fans talking today.\r\n \r\nTHE JUDAS CONTRACT is written by fan-favorite author Marv Wolfman (NEW TEEN TITANS, RAVEN). Collects THE NEW TEEN TITANS #39 and 40, TALES OF THE TEEN TITANS #41-44 and ANNUAL #3.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>新少年泰坦：犹大契约</li><li><span>出版社: </span><a href=\"/person/24742\">DC Comics</a></li><li><span>发售日: </span>1988</li><li><span>页数: </span>193</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"美国","count":1}],"crt":[{"id":31690,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/63/d4/31690_crt_gZesF.jpg","name":"夜翼","desc":"主角"},{"id":35251,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/de/0c/35251_crt_K40mb.jpg","name":"丧钟","desc":"主角"}],"staff":[{"id":24742,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/f5/df/24742_prsn_rT8SB.jpg","name":"DC漫画","desc":"出版社"}],"relations":[{"id":213442,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/28/ae/213442_nrZYR.jpg","title":"Teen Titans: The Judas Contract","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/213442"}]}
