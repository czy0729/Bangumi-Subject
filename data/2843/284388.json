In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets.

Do whatever it takes to break the loop.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>死亡循环</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32710\">Arkane Studios</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/10310\">Bethesda Softworks</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PS5</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2021年9月14日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://bethesda.net/en/game/deathloop</li>","collection":{"on_hold":14,"dropped":8,"wish":81,"collect":76,"doing":13},"tags":[{"name":"FPS","count":21},{"name":"Arkane","count":16},{"name":"科幻","count":13},{"name":"PC","count":12},{"name":"PS5","count":10},{"name":"STEAM","count":6},{"name":"潜行","count":5},{"name":"射击","count":5},{"name":"箱庭","count":3},{"name":"2021","count":3},{"name":"解谜","count":3},{"name":"ImmersiveSim","count":2},{"name":"130","count":1},{"name":"AVG","count":1},{"name":"大作","count":1},{"name":"=","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":10310,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5f/1c/10310_prsn_t588m.jpg","name":"Bethesda Softworks","desc":"发行"},{"id":32710,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/fc/af/32710_prsn_8903K.jpg","name":"Arkane Studios","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":362009,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ad/c4/362009_DV56J.jpg","title":"DEATHLOOP Original Game Soundtrack","type":"原声集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/362009"}]}
