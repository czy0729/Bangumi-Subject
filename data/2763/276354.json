I analysed, through a film camera, a loop of thirty-six squarish black-and-white photographs representing a human being moving in a circle. What was the logic of my analysis? I decided to photograph the loop on film and repeat it thirty-six times. During every new repetition I divided the film window which I made in the shape of a square so that in every circle there was an increasing number of subdivisions; today I would say different resolutions. I put a white square of paper in the subdivisions where in the photograph there was a part of a figure; where there was not, I put a black square. I had to rearrange the white and black squares at least a hundred thousand times. On the lens I put a color filter, and then rotated it - but I don't want to bore you. What is most important about this is that not being aware of computer imaging - it was 1970, in Poland - I manufactured my own digitalê processing on film. Strange that I needed twenty-six years of work - including my work during all my next twenty five vacations - to come back to Kwadrat with full awareness and understanding of why.”\r\n　　- Zbig Rybczynski ","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>矩形</li><li><span>别名: </span>Square</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>*1972</li><li><span>片长: </span>3分32秒</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":2},{"name":"1972","count":1}]}
