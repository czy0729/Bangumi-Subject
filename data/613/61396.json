There are however several new additions. The playable characters are Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass and Duo, with Duo being a new addition to the cast. The four characters feature different attributes and abilities. When playing 2-Player, only one of the players can get the Robot Master's weapon.\r\nAs in The Power Battle there are three \"stories\" to choose from after; finding Dr. Wily, saving Roll, and recovering the stolen parts. All stories have different Robot Masters to fight, and halfway through it the player is given a different power-up. Unlike the previous game, The Power Fighters lets the player choose freely between Robot Master stages, and is given some hints on what the Robot Masters weaknesses are. Each of the characters can perform a special attack, which is executed by releasing a full buster charge while holding the joystick up. Megaman's special move, the \"Mega Upper,\" is simply a jumping uppercut (like the Shoryuken); Protoman's special move, the \"Proto Strike,\" allows him to shoot a massive, short-ranged burst of energy; Bass' special move, the \"Crescent Kick,\" (Which is like the Flash Kick, another Street Fighter ability), lets him perform a somersaulting kick; Duo's special move, the \"Giant Knuckle,\" is a standing uppercut that flings the enemy upwards (if the attack button is pressed again after the uppercut, Duo will jump up and slam the enemy down to the ground).","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>洛克人 力量对决2</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/24664\">奥河英樹</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>洛克人2 : 强大的战士</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~2</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996年7月9日</li>","collection":{"collect":18,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARC","count":7},{"name":"FTG","count":6},{"name":"Capcom","count":4},{"name":"ARCADE","count":3},{"name":"洛克人","count":2},{"name":"1996","count":1},{"name":"模拟器","count":1}],"crt":[{"id":63836,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ff/01/63836_crt_U6m6c.jpg","name":"洛克人","desc":"椎名へきる"},{"id":63426,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/2b/17/63426_crt_JlyyB.jpg","name":"罗露","desc":"配角"}],"staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"开发"},{"id":24664,"image":"","name":"奥河英树","desc":"音乐"}],"relations":[{"id":61397,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/71/57/61397_sSOtF.jpg","title":"ロックマン・ザ・パワーバトル","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/61397"},{"id":261157,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4c/81/261157_mQGG2.jpg","title":"ロックマン バトル&ファイターズ","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/261157"}]}
