Two players can play the game together as different characters, teaming up to defeat the bosses.\r\nThe game plays much like the main Mega Man games - the player uses one button to jump, and one to fire the character's arm-mounted energy gun. Holding the fire button charges the gun in order to release a stronger blast. Holding down while pressing the jump button makes the character do a dash, the appearance of which varies between characters.\r\nAfter choosing a character, the player chooses between three \"stories\", with each one having different Robot Masters from various games. The \"stories\" are Mega Man 1-2, 3-6 and Mega Man 7. Upon choosing a \"story\", the game quickly pans through the various levels, letting the player choose one roulette-style.\r\nA level is largely different from the mainstream Mega Man games; instead of going through an entire stage and fighting the Robot Master as a boss at the end, the player faces the Robot Master immediately. Killing a Robot Master earns the player their weapon, which can be switched to by pressing a button. Like in most Mega Man games, each Robot Master is weak to another one's weapon, so the player can fight through them in a \"rock-paper-scissors\" kind of way.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>洛克人 力量对决</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/24664\">奥河英樹</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Mega Man: The Power Battle</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~2</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995年10月18日</li>","collection":{"collect":14,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"ARC","count":7},{"name":"FTG","count":4},{"name":"ARCADE","count":3},{"name":"Capcom","count":3},{"name":"1995","count":1}],"crt":[{"id":63836,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ff/01/63836_crt_U6m6c.jpg","name":"洛克人","desc":"椎名へきる"},{"id":63426,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/2b/17/63426_crt_JlyyB.jpg","name":"罗露","desc":"配角"}],"staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"开发"},{"id":24664,"image":"","name":"奥河英树","desc":"音乐"}],"relations":[{"id":61396,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6a/d0/61396_o3Spy.jpg","title":"ロックマン2・ザ・パワーファイターズ","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/61396"},{"id":82758,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/bf/d8/82758_kTT2k.jpg","title":"ロックマン","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/82758"},{"id":261157,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4c/81/261157_mQGG2.jpg","title":"ロックマン バトル&ファイターズ","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/261157"}]}
