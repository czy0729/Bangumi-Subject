{"id":308594,"type":4,"name":"Gotcha","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c7/cf/308594_7kMkl.jpg","summary":"In Gotcha two players travel through a maze. Player 1 is the Pursued, represented by a plus sign, and player 2 is the Pursuer, represented by a square. The Pursuer's goal is to catch the Pursued, while the Pursued's goal is to stay away until time runs out. The closer the Pursuer is to the Pursued, the faster the frequency of the electronic beeping in the background. The maze walls shift, potentially blocking paths and creating new ones.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a>、<a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a>（日本）</li><li><span>平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Maze</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1973年10月11日 (北美)</li><li><span>其他发行日期: </span>1974年11月 (日本)</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Allan Alcorn</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"},{"id":1598,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9c/19/1598_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"南梦宫","desc":"发行"}]}
