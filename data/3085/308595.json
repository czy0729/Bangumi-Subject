In the game, two players each control paddles on either side of a volleyball net, with a ball dropped from the top of the screen. The players bounce the ball back and forth across the net with the goal of scoring points by having the ball reach the bottom or side of the other player's half of the screen, with the trajectory of the ball dependent on where it strikes the paddle. The winner is the first player to reach eleven or fifteen points, depending on the game settings.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a>、Kee Games</li><li><span>平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1974年2月</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
