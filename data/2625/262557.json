It is the direct sequel to Raiden Fighters, which is part of the Raiden scrolling shooter game legacy. This game shares the same intense gameplay as its predecessor, as well as expanding on the concepts that defined it. It is followed by Raiden Fighters Jet, the third and final game so far in the series. Also new music,sound affects,and graphics are introduced into the game.\r\nThe later Raiden Fighters 2 - 2000 Operation Hell Dive clone runs on cheaper hardware and features notoriously inferior sound than the original.

This version of Raiden Fighters 2 is a stand-alone version that has all fighters available immediately.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>雷电战机2</li><li><span>别名: </span>RAIDEN FIGHTERS 2 -OPERATION HELL DIVE-</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>ライデンファイターズツー</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>雷电快打2</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>纵版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1997年</li><li><span>开发: </span>セイブ開発</li><li><span>发行: </span>セイブ開発</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"relations":[{"id":262555,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/95/d8/262555_2ildd.jpg","title":"ライデンファイターズ","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/262555"},{"id":262558,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/38/83/262558_NIy61.jpg","title":"ライデンファイターズJET","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/262558"},{"id":58017,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/af/9a/58017_53ie7.jpg","title":"ライデンファイターズ エイシズ","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/58017"},{"id":94799,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/70/6d/94799_s05SA.jpg","title":"Raiden Legacy","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/94799"}]}
