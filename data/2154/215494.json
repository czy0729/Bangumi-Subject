This game is quite different from the previous installments as the whole concept was changed. The player can no longer drive around in free roam unless they decide to go around the map during a delivery, but they can only pick a job offer from the selection menu if users have met its requirements of having multiple new trucks and accomplished deliveries. The trucks and cars are modeled after real brands, although users can not own any vehicles through the game and are simply truck drivers seeking various jobs. Still, today's low to mediocre range computer will be able to run the game without getting low FPS. The game was mostly poorly received by critics. Game was criticised mostly for change of series concept. But it was well received by players and some reviews were positive towards the game and praised the game for its graphics and gameplay.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>18轮大卡车：极限卡车司机</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/21073\">SCS Software</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SIM</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2009年9月23日</li><li><span>发行: </span>ValuSoft</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":21073,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b1/1b/21073_prsn_xDxLC.jpg","name":"SCS Software","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":215495,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f6/78/215495_vsXk0.jpg","title":"18 Wheels of Steel: Extreme Trucker 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/215495"},{"id":215492,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d2/92/215492_b868e.jpg","title":"18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/215492"}]}
