These battalions are famous for being formed under Stalin’s \"No step back!\" order #227. They consisted of court-martialed officers that were given a chance to redeem their crimes, or incompetence, in blood by serving as the lowest enlisted rank in a battalion that was assigned the most dangerous tasks. These battalions’ images are surrounded by many myths, and this game tells the truth about these regiments based on real evidence from their former members.\r\nTake command of one of these notorious companies and lead it to victory against all odds through most of the war on the Eastern front. Fight from desperate battles in 1942 in the area of Volyn in the Ukraine, to the massive operation “Bagration” in the Brest area, Magnush bridgehead and Warsaw area in Poland and finally to attacks on the German Altdam and Stettin near the end of the war.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>战争之人：负罪英雄</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RTS/RTT</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>GEM 2</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人/多人游戏</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2012年4月12日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.menofwargame.com/games/condemnedheroes</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":7,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"俄罗斯","count":2},{"name":"二战","count":2},{"name":"RTT","count":2},{"name":"卫国战争","count":1},{"name":"STEAM","count":1},{"name":"2012","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":207741,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c5/ba/207741_gEb8G.jpg","title":"Men of War","type":"主线故事","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/207741"}]}
