On his way to a planet which has a fountain of immortality, Tyler makes a pit stop at F.A.K.K.² (Federation-Assigned Ketogenic Killzone) because its inhabitants carry some immortality water in their bodies. Tyler abducts a few people and kills the rest, but misses one: Julie, the sole survivor enraged by Tyler's careless rampage, vows to avenge her family and kill Tyler before he reaches the fountain.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>宇宙奇趣录 2000</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>别名: </span>宇宙神怪录 2000</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>重金属 2000</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2000-04-19</li><li><span>片长: </span>88 分钟</li><li><span>导演: </span>Michael Coldewey</li>","collection":{"collect":2,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"冷门","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":992799,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/992799","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":113087,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a3/a5/113087_YY7e7.jpg","title":"Heavy Metal","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/113087"},{"id":321083,"image":"","title":"Heavy Metal","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/321083"}]}
