Since then the game has been featured in numerous different sites and cover discs. Players have also made their own levels with the PK2 Level Editor, which was released later in 2003. Check the link section at the bottom of the page for more information. Pekka Kana 2 has also been translated to several languages, and you can download the language files and manuals from the bottom of this page.\r\n\r\nThe installer includes episodes Rooster Island 1 and Rooster Island 2, and a huge amount of translations. So install the game first, and download a translation if it doesn't come with the game.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately because the game is quite old and uses old version of DirectX (7), many experience problems when trying to run the game on modern OSs like Windows Vista and graphics cards that don't support all of Direct 7's old 2D features. Recommended setup for PK2 is Windows 98 and an old graphics card.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>公鸡冒险2</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://pistegamez.net/game_pk2.html</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
