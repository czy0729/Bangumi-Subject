The game follows Sonic the Hedgehog as he attempts to restore the world to normal after his nemesis, Doctor Eggman, splits the world into pieces, as well as his struggles with his new beast form, Sonic the Werehog. Gameplay features two distinct styles, with each being played either during daytime or night-time. Daytime stages incorporate Sonic's traditional platforming and trademark speed, with a combination of behind-the-back third-person viewpoints and 2D side-scroller platforming; gameplay seamlessly transitions between these two views.[14] Night-time levels see Sonic transform into the Werehog; gameplay slows down to accommodate greater platform play, and involves combat against waves of enemies using the Werehog's brute strength.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>索尼克 释放</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a>、<a href=\"/person/32714\">ディンプス</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>动画制作: </span><a href=\"/person/38032\">黒木信幸</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ソニック ワールドアドベンチャー</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>音速小子 世界大冒险</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>WII</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>XBOX360</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>平台动作</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2008年11月18日</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":13,"on_hold":1,"dropped":3},"tags":[{"name":"SEGA","count":1},{"name":"WII","count":1},{"name":"PS3","count":1}],"crt":[{"id":75332,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/79/48/75332_crt_d04ZO.jpg","name":"索尼克","desc":"金丸淳一"}],"staff":[{"id":32714,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/91/52/32714_prsn_bbeQn.jpg","name":"Dimps","desc":"开发"},{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"开发"},{"id":38032,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/08/01/38032_prsn_besxb.jpg","name":"黒木信幸","desc":"动画制作"}],"relations":[{"id":24869,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ce/c8/24869_jp.jpg","title":"SONIC WORLD ADVENTURE Original Soundtrack「Planetary Pieces」","type":"原声集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/24869"}]}
