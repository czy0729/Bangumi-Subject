Most notably, each of the 9 characters featured in the game sports armor of some kind or another that can be broken off by opponents leaving characters much more vulnerable and able to take much more damage. A human shaped meter in the top corners of the screen monitors the damage to your armor. Secondly walls surround each arena, caging the combatants in, allowing for attacks in conjunction with them (bouncing off etc.), and if the correct combination is hit at the round's finale, characters can punch their opponent straight through the walls.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>格斗之蛇</li><li><span>制作总指挥: </span><a href=\"/person/36581\">鈴木裕</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Fighting Vipers</li><li><span>平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>XBOX360</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~2</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995年（ARC）</li>","collection":{"collect":11},"tags":[{"name":"PS3","count":3},{"name":"FTG","count":2},{"name":"ARCADE","count":2},{"name":"ARC","count":1},{"name":"通关","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":36581,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/46/60/36581_prsn_rBhPs.jpg","name":"铃木裕","desc":"制作总指挥"}],"relations":[{"id":35496,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ea/68/35496_F48Zz.jpg","title":"プロジェクト クロスゾーン","type":"角色出演","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/35496"}]}
