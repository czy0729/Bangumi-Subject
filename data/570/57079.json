The first version of the game was released in South Korea and was later followed by Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, Portuguese and English translations. The North American/European version of the game launched its retail phase on February 21, 2006. A mixture of science fiction and classic fantasy, RF Online is set in a distant planet in the Novus system where magic exists alongside high technology. Like most MMORPGs it follows the typical fantasy setting complete with swords and sorcery, but it also emphasizes the three-way Race vs. Race vs. Race (RvRvR) concept and modern/futuristic technology such as mecha and nuclear weapons.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>国度 Online</li><li><span>别名: </span>라이징 포스</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>MMORPG</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>韩服 2006年2月21日/日服 2007年6月8日</li>","collection":{"collect":2,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":2}],"relations":[{"id":147522,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/21/4f/147522_jp.jpg","title":"THE FORCE OF LOVE/Lia sings for RF online","type":"插入歌","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/147522"}]}
