However, after releasing a playthrough for the song on youtube, with some choice doodles of an anime girl trying to get noticed by her senpai, I was slowly convinced that doing an EP of anime inspired music would be a good idea.\r\n\r\nIn the Senpai EP, each song is meant to capture different vibes from anime music.\r\n\r\n\"Oh Shit, I'm Late for School!\" follows that now classic trope of running to school for a piece of toast in your mouth and the electro-pop style is one that is very often used for slice of life or romantic comedy anime.\r\n\r\n\"Senpai, Please Notice Me!\" tries to capture that tried and tested trope of falling in love with your high school senpai, one that is used so much in anime that it became an internet meme.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, \"The Power of Love and Friendship!\" is meant to represent the vibe from battle anime, where even if you're badly losing a fight, just remembering that you're really good friends with everyone will spur you onto victory.\r\n\r\nThis EP is unashamedly cheesy and cliché and I make no apologies for it, because it was incredibly fun to make and if it conveys even a fraction of the enjoyment that I get out of anime to you, then I consider this EP a success.\r\n\r\nI hope you all enjoy the Senpai EP. I-i-it's not like I made it for you guys or anything! \r\ncredits\r\nreleased October 12, 2015","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>先輩EP</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>2015/10/12</li><li><span>价格: </span>£4</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>13:50</li>","eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Oh Shit, I'm Late For School!
