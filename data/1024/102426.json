You must literally edit and re-execute the very Javascript running the game in your browser to save Dr. Eval from this dark and confusing reality!\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nThe game presents you with a roguelike-like playing environment and a console window with the JavaScript code generating each level.
