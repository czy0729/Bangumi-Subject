It was later ported to the PlayStation in 1999. It is a partial remake of Dune II, which is loosely based on Frank Herbert's Dune universe. The story of the game is similar to Dune II, and is continued in Emperor: Battle for Dune. The game uses a similar game engine to Westwood's Command & Conquer: Red Alert. Although Dune 2000 was originally intended to be a remake of Dune II, the plotline differs completely and makes a reference to the execution of Mentat Amon of House Ordos and the replacement of the Harkonnen Mentat from Dune II, Radnor, by Hayt De Vries. The story is told with full motion video.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>沙丘2000</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/17815\">Westwood Studios</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RTS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1998年8月31日</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":33},"tags":[{"name":"RTS","count":11},{"name":"PC","count":9},{"name":"westwood","count":6},{"name":"沙丘","count":3},{"name":"1998","count":2},{"name":"即使战略","count":2},{"name":"ARC","count":1},{"name":"红警","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":17815,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/de/72/17815_prsn_nPUiT.jpg","name":"西木工作室","desc":"开发"},{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"艺电","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":19748,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/fc/b5/19748_nyx6b.jpg","title":"沙丘三部曲","type":"书籍","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/19748"},{"id":256461,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/04/21/256461_74Q2v.jpg","title":"Dune II","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/256461"}]}
