It asks one simple question – how will you die? \r\n\r\nIn the towns of Muldraugh and West Point, survivors must loot houses, build defences and do their utmost to delay their inevitable death day by day. No help is coming – their continued survival relies on their own cunning, luck and ability to evade a relentless horde.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>僵尸毁灭工程</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Zombie Survival RPG available</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Custom</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2013年11月8日</li><li><span>售价: </span>US$14.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.projectzomboid.com/</li><li><span>Indie DB: </span>http://www.indiedb.com/games/project-zomboid</li><li><span>开发: </span>The Indie Stone</li><li><span>发行: </span>The Indie Stone</li>","collection":{"on_hold":19,"dropped":7,"wish":24,"collect":76,"doing":18},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":20},{"name":"STEAM","count":16},{"name":"丧尸","count":14},{"name":"生存","count":13},{"name":"沙盒","count":8},{"name":"恐怖","count":6},{"name":"沙盒游戏","count":3},{"name":"2013年","count":3},{"name":"SIM","count":1},{"name":"模拟","count":1},{"name":"20小时","count":1},{"name":"合作","count":1},{"name":"视频通关","count":1},{"name":"GOG","count":1},{"name":"RPG","count":1},{"name":"","count":""}]}
