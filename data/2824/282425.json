In addition to reopening the coal mines, a part of Lister's plan to help her family is to marry well. But the charismatic, single-minded Lister -- who dresses head-to-toe in black and charms her way into high society -- has no intention of marrying a man. \"Gentleman Jack\" examines Lister's relationships with her family, servants, tenants and industrial rivals, and would-be wife. The real-life Anne Lister's story was recorded in her diaries, and the most intimate details of her life are revealed for the series.\r\nBBC One及HBO合拍8集劇《傑克紳士 Gentleman Jack》（前名《Shibden Hall》）由Sally Wainwright負責，美方現定於美國時間4月22日首播，英方會較晚播出。\r\n《傑克紳士》是根據現實人物Anne Lister所改篇，在1832年的Halifax，被當地人稱為傑克紳士/ Gentleman Jack的Anne Lister（Suranne Jones飾）是個富有的地主，她亦是位日記作者﹑旅行家，並且自知及開放地以女同性戀身份生活的人，被稱為”The first modern lesbian”。劇中將會描述她與家人﹑仆人﹑房客﹑商業對手，以及同性戀人Ann Walker之間的關系。","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>绅士杰克 第一季</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>星期一</li><li><span>制作: </span><a href=\"/person/38628\">HBO</a></li><li><span>集数: </span>8</li><li><span>开始: </span>2019-04-22</li><li><span>结束: </span>2019-06-10</li><li><span>类型: </span>剧情</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国/美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>1h 1min</li><li><span>频道: </span>HBO/BBC One</li><li><span>视频制式: </span>2:1 HDTV</li><li><span>首播国家: </span>美国</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.hbo.com/gentleman-jack</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt7211618</li><li><span>Wikipedia: </span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_Jack_(TV_series)</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":6},"tags":[{"name":"剧情","count":2},{"name":"历史","count":2},{"name":"HBO","count":2},{"name":"百合","count":2},{"name":"英剧","count":1},{"name":"BBC","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":882190,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/882190","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"I Was Just Passing","name_cn":"","duration":"01:01:00","airdate":"2019-04-22","comment":0,"desc":"Rejected by her partner Vere Hobart in Sussex, the worldly Anne Lister returns to Yorkshire and her family's ancestral home, Shibden Hall.
