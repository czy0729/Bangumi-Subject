Frustrated with the direction of the church, Cardinal Bergoglio (Jonathan Pryce) requests permission to retire in 2012 from Pope Benedict (Anthony Hopkins). Instead, facing scandal and self-doubt, the introspective Pope Benedict summons his harshest critic and future successor to Rome to reveal a secret that would shake the foundations of the Catholic Church. Behind Vatican walls, a struggle commences between both tradition and progress, guilt and forgiveness, as these two very different men confront their pasts in order to find common ground and forge a future for a billion followers around the world. Inspired by true events.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>教宗的承继</li><li><span>主演: </span><a href=\"/person/35132\">Anthony Hopkins</a></li><li><span>集数: </span>1</li><li><span>开始: </span>2019-12-20</li><li><span>结束: </span>2019-12-20</li><li><span>类型: </span>传记 喜剧 剧情</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>125min</li><li><span>电视网: </span>Netflix</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt8404614</li>","collection":{"collect":7},"tags":[{"name":"2019；传记；","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":923320,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/923320","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":35132,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/14/b0/35132_prsn_9mac9.jpg","name":"安东尼·霍普金斯","desc":"主演"}]}
