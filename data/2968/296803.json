However, once he finds out that his sweetheart Adiana is a descendant of an ancient god, and that young men of the village participate in a dangerous ritual in order to be chosen as her husband, the hero decides he must act. Little does he know that this would just be the beginning of a long adventure, involving all this stuff he is not interested in... plus lots of pretty girls!","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC-98</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>WIN95</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ADV+RPG</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994-09-02</li><li><span>ブランド: </span>天津堂</li>","collection":{"collect":2}}
