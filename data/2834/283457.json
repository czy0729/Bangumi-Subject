You join the Casual Romance Club in order to meet other people and perhaps find love. There are twelve girls you can approach, each one possessing her own unique beauty and personality. Use your time and efforts wisely and you may just get yourself more than a casual romance...\r\n\r\nYou are given a month to shop around and win somebody's love, after which you'll ask the girl of your choice to keep seeing you even after the club adjourns. Each game day starts at the Starry Sky restaurant, with the club notebook laid out for you. The club notebook has the lowdown on all the girls -- their basic statistics, pictures, horoscopes, likes, dislikes, etc. The girls also record their thoughts and reactions on daily events next to their horoscopes, so reading the club notebook can prove vital to your success.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>Casual Romance Club</li><li><span>平台: </span>Sega Saturn</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996/12/13</li><li><span>Developer: </span>Libido</li><li><span>Publisher: </span>Kid</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2}}
