Field of View, Fog of War, Cover, Zone of Control, Charging and Flanking, various and abundant tactical elements are implemented in the combat system of Low Magic Age. The game rules are evolved from the Open Game License (OGL), the set of rules based on the pen-n-paper version of fantasy role-playing games of all time, made by Wizards of the Coast.\r\n\r\nIn order to apply a set of rules designed for a pen-and-paper game to a computer game, many rules in the open game content had been adjusted or improved.\r\n\r\nNormally, you'll create and customize a small party of 4~6 characters: choosing from seven races, three basic classes and ten class variants, dozens of feats and spells. And then fight with all kinds of monsters!\r\n\r\n——官网简介","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>低魔时代</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2017年1月11日</li><li><span>售价: </span>36</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.lowmagicage.com/</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":5,"on_hold":2},"tags":[{"name":"2021下","count":1}]}
