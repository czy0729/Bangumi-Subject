Alan convinces Raphael to let him give a talk to the sixth formers at the school where Raphael is now headmaster.\r\n\r\nWhilst at the school, Alan bumps into an old schoolmate who is now a teacher (Ian Puleston-Davies). They try to reminisce over old times, but Alan still holds a grudge against this man, who once drew a penis on the back of his school blazer in chalk; which Alan was caned for.\r\n\r\nLater Alan begins his talk to the students which, of course, all goes wrong. Alan ends up insulting Raphael for caning him when he was younger and also insults his schoolmate for \"getting the lab assistant pregnant, and never sees the kid.\" All of this results in Alan receiving a stern talking-to in the headmaster's office.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the episode, the reviled schoolmate comes into the petrol station; Alan, thinking he has come to fight, tries to threaten him with an apple turnover. The schoolmate apologises to Alan and hopes that they can be friends again, but as the schoolmate leaves the petrol station a customer tells him that he has got something on his back: Alan got Lynn to draw a chalk penis on his back.\r\n\r\nThe episode ends with Alan being besieged in the petrol station.","status":"Air"},{"id":275034,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/275034","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"The Colour of Alan","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2002-11-18","comment":0,"desc":"Michael comes to stay for a few days after his front door is stolen; Alan is asked to present a sales conference for \"Dante's of Reading,\" a company that supplies coal-effect fires and fireplaces. Dante's Piet Morant (Steve Brody), a South African, visits Alan's partially built house.\r\n\r\nAfter his frequent pranks with the security staff at his country club backfire and the police are called, Alan is forced to bring Piet to his partially built house. Lynn and Michael improvise some make-shift furniture in the empty house: they balance a toilet door on a Black & Decker Workmate for a table and attach several torches to a bicycle wheel for lighting. This fails to impress Morant, who is even less impressed by Alan's attempt at a South African accent or his misunderstanding of Piets pronunciation of the word 'can't'.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Alan is awarded the job, but tragedy ensues when Alan tries to climb over a country club's fence and impales his foot on a metal spike. Lynn tells him to stay in hospital but Alan is completely adamant about doing the speech for \"Dante's of Reading.\" Unfortunately, his dry vomiting and foot pain turn his speech into a disaster.","status":"Air"},{"id":275035,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/275035","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Brave Alan","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2002-11-25","comment":0,"desc":"Alan makes a new friend at the BP garage, Dan (Stephen Mangan).

Alan's attempts to impress Karen Colman are hugely unsuccessful; he even admits to her that he had mental health issues. She strikes up an instant rapport with Sonia, however, later inviting her back to her house without Alan.\r\n\r\nOn hearing that the Colmans' family motto is \"Too much mustard gets up your nose,\" Alan tries desperately to impress her by eating a big spoonful of mustard. However, an unimpressed Karen has put this down to Alan's previously declared \"mental health\", leaving him further humiliated.\r\n\r\nLater, at Dan's home, Alan finds out that Dan and his wife enjoy a deviantly spicy lifestyle; to his great discomfort, they show him a tape of them having intercourse.","status":"Air"},{"id":275036,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/275036","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Never Say Alan Again","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2002-12-02","comment":0,"desc":"Alan plans a Bond-athon (watching all the Bond films in sequential order) for the bank holiday weekend with Michael.

This leads to him having a minor argument with Sonia, which is all seen by the tax people. In order to make things up to her, he takes her to Bono's house (really Blickling Hall), after falsely claiming to be a personal friend of his.
