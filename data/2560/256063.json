The object of the game is to drive down roads in the technologically advanced \"Interceptor\" car and destroy various enemy vehicles with a variety of onboard weapons. Spy Hunter was produced in both sit-down and standard upright versions with the latter being more common. The game's controls consist of a steering wheel in the form of a futuristic aircraft-style yoke with several special-purpose buttons, a two-position stick shift (offering 'low' and 'high' gears), and a pedal used for acceleration.\r\nSpy Hunter was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit family, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Apple II, ColecoVision, MS-DOS, Nintendo Entertainment System, and BBC Micro. Spy Hunter was followed by Spy Hunter II which added a 3D view and two-player split-screen play, a pinball tie-in, and a successor series of games bearing the Spy Hunter name. In addition, the NES received an exclusive sequel titled Super Spy Hunter.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>间谍猎人</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32718\">Midway Games</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32718\">Midway Games</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>ZX Spectrum</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>C64</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Apple II</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MS-DOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Vehicular combat</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1983年</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":32718,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/14/80/32718_prsn_HD7Yl.jpg","name":"Midway Games","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":240824,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d4/ff/240824_Z65QI.jpg","title":"バトルフォーミュラ","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/240824"}]}
