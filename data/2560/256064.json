The video game was published by Absolute Entertainment in North America and Europe and by Jaleco in Japan. A Boy and His Blob follows an unnamed, male protagonist and his shapeshifting blob friend on their adventure to save the planet of Blobolonia from the clutches of an evil emperor.\r\nA Boy and His Blob is a platform-puzzle game that puts the player in control of the boy; its gameplay revolves around feeding his blob companion different flavored jelly beans to change its shape into various tools in order to overcome obstacles and traverse the game's world. A Boy and His Blob was designed and programmed by David Crane. Licensed by Nintendo in the summer of 1989, development began and was completed in an intense six-week period. Crane has described the game's overall concept of a boy accompanied by a morphing blob as unconventional and wanted to try his own hand at implementing useful tools for the player.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>男孩与泡泡怪</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii VC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1990年1月</li><li><span>开发: </span>Imagineering</li><li><span>发行: </span>Absolute Entertainment</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"relations":[{"id":220201,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e1/5e/220201_ibPD1.jpg","title":"A Boy and His Blob","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/220201"}]}
