This is the first wrestling game to feature a play-by-play announcer, the animated Tom Talker, although his speech was only text bubbles. The game's text, e.g. Tom Talker's commentary, was translated from the Japanese game almost directly, leading to instances of Engrish. For example the Northern Lights Suplex is called \"Northern Right Suplex\". The game was released in Japan under the name Gekitou Pro Wrestling!! Toukon Densetsu (激闘プロレス!! 闘魂伝説 Gekitou Puroresu!! Toukon Densetsu)","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>TECMO世界摔跤</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/33279\">テクモ</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/33279\">テクモ</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Tecmo World Wrestling</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>激斗摔跤!!斗魂传说</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>特库摩世界摔交</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1989年9月1日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"SPG","count":1},{"name":"FC","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":33279,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5b/e9/33279_prsn_MDpkY.jpg","name":"特库摩","desc":"开发"}]}
