It is well known for successfully using digitized vocals and electric guitar in the opening theme (composed, along with the rest of the game's music, by Rob Hubbard), rarely seen on the NES. A 2012 three-part video interview on black metal revealed that the skater on the box art was young Jef Whitehead, the sole member of Leviathan.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>滑冰2</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>生死滑板2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>滑板生死斗2</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Action adventure</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1990年</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"艺电","desc":"开发"}]}
