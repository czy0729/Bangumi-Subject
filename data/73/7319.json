Lifestate, Kate’s insurance provider, has put a stop to the surgery two days before it’s scheduled because they don’t cover experimental procedures. SLG is also in charge of a class action lawsuit against Lifestate and the case with the Willoughbys would set the precedent for the 68 other cases where Lifestate denied coverage. Lifestate’s lawyer offers Will a deal, drop the class action suit and they’ll find the money to save her baby, but Will says no. When it looks like the outcome will be in favor of Kate, Lifestate’s defense claims that Kate’s husband inaccurately filled out their application for coverage and thus voids their contract for insurance. With Kalinda’s help, Will gets leverage on Lifestate’s unethical practices and rather than the information becoming public, a settlement is reached and the baby’s surgery is a success.
