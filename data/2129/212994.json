Each episode will revolve around a different character, so there will be more than one protagonist. The first episode will contain futuristic themes, city life, and what makes a person feel \"alive.\" The plot in these games will also be straight-forward, but if you don't take the time to explore the whole city, you could miss some important details. There are two ways to play the first game: casual and curious.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>HMKid!</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Adventure</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>RPG Maker VX Ace</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>01 January 2017 (EP1 Demo)</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://renkura.itch.io/happymelancholicdemo</li>","collection":{"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"RM","count":1}]}
