{"id":212988,"type":4,"name":"Momodora I","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/27/ff/212988_S3DEC.jpg","summary":"Momodora I is the first game in the Momodora series.\r\n\r\nThis game takes a lot of inspiration from other titles such as Cave Story and Mega Man. It's sort of a love letter to those games. It was also the first game project I completed, so it's very roughly put together and really unpolished. I advise you to play the sequels instead!\r\n\r\nThe game follows the story of Isadora, an orphaned child who goes into a forbidden land to attempt to ressurect her mother.\r\n\r\nIt's meant to be challenging like an \"arcade\" game. I hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nTitle screen artwork was drawn by Temmie Chang!","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platformer</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>24 July 2014</li><li><span>售价: </span>Free</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://rdein.itch.io/momodora-i</li>","collection":{"collect":3,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":1}]}
