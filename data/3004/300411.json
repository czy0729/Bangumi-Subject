Avoid enemies and hit percussive notes on the beat to accumulate points and fill your Treble Charge to blast through anything in your path.\r\n\r\nTadpole Treble features 30 original music compositions, 13 levels, and 5 boss battles. In addition to the story mode, the game includes bonus content such as unlockable music, a large bestiary, game commentaries, and online leaderboards for every level. Best of all is the robust Composition Mode which lets players create their own original levels and music!","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>macOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SteamOS + Linux</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>音乐</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2016年9月3日</li><li><span>售价: </span>¥ 21</li>"}
