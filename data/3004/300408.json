But it will be in your head for a long time after.\r\n\r\nWHY WE MADE IT\r\nWe made Beckett as a story that could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the best of literature, theatre and independent world cinema. It won the Games category in the 2018 BAFTA Scotland awards, made various game-of-the-year lists (2018) and was made part of V&A Dundee's permanent gallery collection.\r\n\r\nYou could call it a psychological horror. You could call it an anti-love story. You could call it a surrealist nightmare. Beckett is a disturbing, unique experience that will make you question what it is to exist.\r\n\r\nThe game puts reality under the spotlight, drawing you into a missing person's case set in a dark and unforgiving world. Our main character, Beckett, morns the loss of his wife - she was everything to him, but time has passed and life has lost meaning. Then there's the City, which plays with Beckett like cat with a baby bird, making him act against his will. You must take control, explore, navigate, interact, talk, defy... we're all memories waiting to happen, we're all memories waiting to fade.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>macOS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>P&C</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2018年2月27日</li><li><span>售价: </span>¥ 37</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":1}]}
