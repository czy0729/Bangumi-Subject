Wrangle the hands and arms of space cosmonauts and push, pull and twist your way through a precarious range of physically-simulated stellar scenarios where, without gravity, nothing is still, nothing is secure, and nothing is simple.\r\n\r\nOn a good day, the beauty of weightlessness will shine through. You'll use your sharp mind and dexterous limbs to assemble space telescopes, maintain delicate solar arrays and research cosmic botany. On worse days you'll be missing gravity's embrace, when: the power is out, you're in the firing line of supersonic space debris and... there's a breadstick stuck in the emergency backup generator.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>模拟</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2021</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://heavenlybodiesgame.com</li><li><span>开发: </span>2pt Interactive</li>","collection":{"wish":1}}
