The game debuted in Japan at the 2001 Amusement Operators Union trade show as Monkey Ball, an arcade cabinet running on Sega's NAOMI hardware and controlled with a distinctive banana-shaped analog stick. Due to the failure of Sega's Dreamcast home console and the company's subsequent restructuring, an enhanced port dubbed Super Monkey Ball was released as a launch title for the GameCube in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega's first game published for a Nintendo home console.\r\nConceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball involves guiding a transparent ball containing one of four monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms. The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the timer reach zero to advance to the next stage. There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超级猴子球</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>导演: </span><a href=\"/person/36640\" rel=\"v:directedBy\">名越稔洋</a></li><li><span>制作总指挥: </span><a href=\"/person/36640\">名越稔洋</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Super Monkey Ball</li><li><span>平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2001年9月14日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"NGC","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"发行"},{"id":36640,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/92/41/36640_prsn_j55uJ.jpg","name":"名越稔洋","desc":"导演"}],"relations":[{"id":91706,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f7/16/91706_Fvyf8.jpg","title":"Super Monkey Ball DS","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/91706"}]}
