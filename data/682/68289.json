The square grid is no longer rigid, as it was in Railroad Tycoon and Railroad Tycoon II - rail and structures can now be rotated 360 degrees.The track building function is not very realistic, as tracks are sometimes built at angles almost at 90 degrees to each other.\r\n\r\nThe economic model has been reworked. In previous games, goods could only be picked up at a station, and revenue depended on the distance between stations. Carloads in RT3 slowly move across the map (representing road and water transport) along the gradient of a scalar field representing price, where supply and demand sites function as sources and sinks. Revenue depends on the price difference between pick-up and delivery. This has several effects; raw materials can find their way to industries and get processed, without any trains involved, and a train does not need to pick up goods at the source.\r\n\r\nOther changes include: each carload of mail, passengers and troops now has a destination; car setup can be automated, so that trains always pick up the cars that yield the most revenue; warehouse buildings also appear in the game, completing the commodity market the same way as ports do; trains can pass each other on a single track (as in RT1 on lowest difficulty level); no need for signal towers, as well as station improvements (post offices, restaurants etc.), are placed individually on the map; players can buy industries, and also build processing industries wherever they like; processing industries have limited capacity, but they can be upgraded.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>铁路大亨3</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/41641\">Gathering of Developers</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS X</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>商业模拟</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003年10月27日</li><li><span>开发商: </span>PopTop Software</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":14,"doing":1,"on_hold":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"火车","count":1},{"name":"修铁路","count":1},{"name":"2003","count":1},{"name":"模拟","count":1},{"name":"经营","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":41641,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/c6/e6/41641_prsn_25DOr.jpg","name":"Gathering of Developers","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":68288,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/98/02/68288_1Jcyz.jpg","title":"Railroad Tycoon II","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/68288"},{"id":73093,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/35/60/73093_wE596.jpg","title":"Sid Meier's Railroads!","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/73093"}]}
