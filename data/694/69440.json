Crawford and Graham interview the parents of the latest girl to go missing, only to discover that she has been returned to her bedroom and Graham suspects it is an apologetic gesture on behalf of the killer. As Graham struggles to create a profile, Crawford enlists the help of noted psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen), who takes a keen interest in the case and particularly in Graham, in whom he senses a like-mind. Another girl is found, mounted on top of a deer's head in an open field with her lungs removed and Graham is convinced it is the work of someone else, a negative to show him the positives of the other crimes. Dr. Lecter is shown preparing himself a meal with meat that looks like lungs. Dr. Beverly Katz (Hettienne Park) finds a shred of metal from a pipe-threader on the clothes of the returned girl, which leads Graham and Dr. Lecter to a construction site that employs one Garrett Jacob Hobbs, who fits Graham's profile. Dr. Lecter makes a phone call to Hobbs, warning him that the FBI is onto him and he and Graham arrive at Hobbs' house just as Hobbs kills his own wife.

A final flashback reveals Miriam's fate: she visits Dr. Lecter to ask about an old patient, Jeremy Olmstead, whom he had come into contact with when working as an ER attendant, who has turned up as the latest Ripper victim. While Lecter excuses himself, Miriam finds one of his sketches of the Wound Man, which precisely matches the manner in which Olmstead was murdered.

She has him draw a clock when he tells her that Dr. Lecter had him perform a similar test, and the results solidify her belief that there is a physical explanation for Graham's instability.
