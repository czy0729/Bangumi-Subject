It is a part of Sega's Shining series of video games.\r\nGameplay is most similar to Shining in the Darkness; the player explores towns and dungeons in the first-person view, with battles almost exclusively taking place in dungeons. Battles take place in a turn-based format, maintaining the first-person view but also allowing the player to view allies as they take their actions. As with every previous game in the Shining series, Shining the Holy Ark uses a menu system in which each menu has exactly four options, all represented by icons. One unique mechanic is the \"pixie\" system, where the player can befriend pixies that will attack enemies as the party encounters them.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>光明圣柜</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/31756\">Camelot</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/6989\">桜庭統</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>シャイニング・ザ・ホーリィアーク</li><li><span>平台: </span>SS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996年12月20日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":31756,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/3b/a6/31756_prsn_GGZZe.jpg","name":"Camelot","desc":"开发"},{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"发行"},{"id":6989,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/cb/fd/6989_prsn_z7oHZ.jpg","name":"樱庭统","desc":"音乐"}],"relations":[{"id":283452,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4c/1a/283452_0cNZu.jpg","title":"Shining the Holy Ark ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/283452"},{"id":171334,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f6/11/171334_DDgGf.jpg","title":"Shining & The Darkness","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/171334"}]}
