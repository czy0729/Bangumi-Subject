It’s much simpler than either of those two though, playing more like a traditional arcade action title. There’s barely even a story… After the great galactic war ends, the planet Blau and its citizens are oppressed and discriminated against by the victors. Former military chief Alois Gardona enacts a coup d’état, to bring Blau back to power, and so a coalition of planets is rallied to put a stop to them.
