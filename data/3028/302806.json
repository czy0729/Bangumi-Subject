Even the sea cannot protect them forever. The ice overtakes the undersea home of a lone aquanaut, forcing an unplanned journey of exploration and discovery. Take control and follow a mysterious mechanical creature ever deeper... Could there be others still living on so far beneath the surface?\r\n\r\nManage your oxygen reserves as you make your way through this magnificent underwater world teeming with life. Maintain your suit's pressure resistance as you proceed deeper into the ruins of past civilizations. This hauntingly beautiful aquascape is truly the final frontier for this intrepid last aquanaut.\r\n\r\nWe hope you'll enjoy this incredible adventure — the result of Capcom's signature creativity and design.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Shinsekai Into the Depths</li><li><span>平台: </span>iOS (Apple Arcade)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Deep-sea action/exploration</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019年9月19日</li>","collection":{"wish":6,"collect":5,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"NS","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"开发"}]}
