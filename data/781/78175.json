Having constructed with complextro gimmicks and complicated chord progressions, the musical journey provides the allure of the new dimension of the trance.\r\n\r\nWith the respect for old school rave flavors, \"Past And Then\" brings contrasts of the decadent synths and cutting-edged electro-dubstep beats. During the breakdown, growling basslines and chopped synths causes a tremendous damage to the dancefloor.","info":"<li><span>制作人: </span><a href=\"/person/7094\">Nhato</a></li><li><span>厂牌: </span><a href=\"/person/9649\">Otographic Music</a></li><li><span>版本特性: </span>OTO-024</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>2013.08.07</li><li><span>录音: </span>Otographic Music</li><li><span>碟片数量: </span>1</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":6},"tags":[{"name":"Nhato","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Nhato - Eureka","href":"/ep/296368"},{"title":"2 Nhato - Past And Then","href":"/ep/296369"}]}],"staff":[{"id":7094,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/e2/02/7094_prsn_xkRX4.jpg","name":"福室達也","desc":"制作人"},{"id":9649,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/93/0f/9649_prsn_v4VxO.jpg","name":"Otographic Music","desc":"厂牌"}]}
