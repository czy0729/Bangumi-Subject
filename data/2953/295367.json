Number One!\") is a weird title released by Sunsoft for the Super Famicom system in early 1995. The game is almost unknown, not only because it was never released outside Japan, but also because it was made when the SNES was almost at the end of its commercial life, so that only very few copies were produced: it has since reached high prices on eBay (up to $150 and more) because of this scarcity.\r\nDTAI plays almost like Pocky & Rocky: it is an overhead Shoot 'em Up with two human characters who can jump, run, slide and kick ass with ranged and melee weapons. The main gimmick of the title is that our \"heroes\" can turn into their insanely over-powered fathers for a while before returning into their pathetic young selves, but apart from this it largely plays like the before mentioned title, including smart bombs and the simultaneous 2-player action.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17913\">Sunsoft</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>であえ殿様あっぱれ一番</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Deae Tonosama Appare Ichiban</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995年3月31日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":17913,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/3c/00/17913_prsn_tGoT3.jpg","name":"Sunsoft","desc":"发行"}]}
