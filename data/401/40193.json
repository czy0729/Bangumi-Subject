Marshall and Lily decide to move out on their own, falling in love with a place they can't afford. Robin learns of Lily's bad credit rating due to her compulsive shopping for designer brands, and forces Lily to tell Marshall. Despite this, they are able to finally secure their dream apartment, only to discover it's in a bad location and more poorly constructed than they thought (the floor is tilted). Barney is slapped for the third time on Thanksgiving, which Marshall dubs \"Slapsgiving.\"\r\nTed tells his children he met their mother through a story concerning her yellow umbrella. He finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick's Day party where his future wife was, although they did not meet. Ted attempts to woo Stella (Sarah Chalke), a dermatologist he sees to remove an embarrassing butterfly tattoo. This culminates in a memorable \"two-minute date,\" which incorporates small talk, dinner, a movie, coffee, two cab rides, and a goodnight kiss, all within two minutes. Robin sleeps with Barney after he comforts her following a break-up with a past Canadian love; Ted is infuriated, and decides to stop being friends with Barney. Meanwhile, an unknown woman begins to sabotage Barney's attempts to hook up. His saboteur is revealed to be Abby (Britney Spears), Stella's receptionist, with a vendetta against him for not calling her after they had sex.\r\nIn the season finale, after Ted and Barney get into separate car accidents and end up in the hospital, they renew their friendship. It is revealed Barney has true feelings for Robin, while Ted proposes to Stella in an arcade.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>老爸老妈的浪漫史 第三季</li><li><span>配角: </span><a href=\"/person/44068\">John Cho</a>、<a href=\"/person/43194\">Janet Varney</a>、<a href=\"/person/28523\">Maggie Wheeler</a>、<a href=\"/person/24144\">Bob Odenkirk</a></li><li><span>集数: </span>20</li><li><span>开始: </span>2007-09-24</li><li><span>结束: </span>2008-05-19</li><li><span>类型: </span>情景喜剧</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>21–22 minutes</li><li><span>频道: </span>CBS</li><li><span>视频制式: </span>1080i 16:9 (HDTV)</li><li><span>音频制式: </span>Dolby Digital 5.1</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.cbs.com/primetime/how_i_met_your_mother</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0460649</li>","collection":{"on_hold":0,"dropped":1,"wish":1,"collect":101,"doing":3},"tags":[{"name":"美剧","count":21},{"name":"情景喜剧","count":6},{"name":"老爸老妈的浪漫史","count":6},{"name":"CBS","count":5},{"name":"喜剧","count":5},{"name":"sitcom","count":5},{"name":"2013","count":2},{"name":"Telly-Show","count":1},{"name":"comedy","count":1},{"name":"搞笑","count":1},{"name":"日常","count":1},{"name":"","count":""}],"eps":[{"id":173010,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173010","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"The Locket","duration":"","airdate":"2013-09-23","comment":0,"desc":"Lily在去Farhampton的路上遇到了一个有趣的人, Marshall 被赶下了他飞回纽约的飞机, Barney和Robin发现他俩有可能有血缘关系,Ted准备送Robin一个私人礼物。"},{"id":173011,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173011","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Coming Back","duration":"","airdate":"2013-09-23","comment":0,"desc":"Marshall被迫租车来赶回纽约，这使得Lily开始灌酒然后不小心泄漏给了Barney关于他兄弟婚姻的坏消息。"},{"id":173012,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173012","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Last Time in New York","duration":"","airdate":"2013-09-30","comment":0,"desc":"Barney和Robin准备在长辈们到来酒店之前打一炮，Ted被Lily发现了他离开纽约前的心愿单，Marshall路过Packer Country时碰上了些麻烦。"},{"id":173013,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173013","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173014,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173014","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":1,"desc":""},{"id":173015,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173015","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173016,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173016","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":1,"desc":""},{"id":173017,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173017","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173018,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173018","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173019,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173019","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173020,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173020","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173021,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173021","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173022,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173022","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"Bass Player Wanted","duration":"","airdate":"2013-12-16","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173023,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173023","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173024,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173024","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173025,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173025","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":3,"desc":""},{"id":173026,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173026","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173027,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173027","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173028,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173028","type":0,"sort":19,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":173029,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/173029","type":0,"sort":20,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":""}],"staff":[{"id":24144,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/5c/05/24144_prsn_tzh9U.jpg","name":"Bob Odenkirk","desc":"配角"},{"id":28523,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/cc/e8/28523_prsn_ym3RJ.jpg","name":"Maggie Wheeler","desc":"配角"},{"id":43194,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/6e/bb/43194_prsn_19N4G.jpg","name":"Janet Varney","desc":"配角"},{"id":44068,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/9d/7f/44068_prsn_Zn6Ty.jpg","name":"John Cho","desc":"配角"}],"relations":[{"id":2262,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/02/33/2262_o8HGk.jpg","title":"How I Met Your Mother Season 2","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/2262"},{"id":40290,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/fa/fc/40290_s02oR.jpg","title":"How I Met Your Mother Season 4","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/40290"}]}
