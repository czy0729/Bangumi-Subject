You control the sideways moving paddle at the bottom of the screen and can use it to bounce the moving ball at the bricks above, at the same time avoiding that it passes you and falls out of the game field.\r\n\r\nThere are several special bricks in Magic Spinball, some cannot be broken and other require you to hit them multiple times. There are also Ramp bricks that lets you shoot the ball on top of the layout to land behind the brick wall. You can also collect many different special items that help you to clear out the bricks faster: Laser cannon, Rocket launcher, Multiballs and more.\r\n\r\nThe game is played over 3 levels, each with a strict time limit and varying layout of the bricks. Each layout becomes slightly more difficult and unless you clear it in time, the game ends right there. As you get close to the clearing all the bricks the Warp hole opens up and lets you make an early escape. You have a limited number of balls in the game, apart from your initial starting ball you only get 3 extra balls. Losing them all means losing the game.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>动作</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.king.com/games/action-games/magic-spinball</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
