It's not that Mum and Dad aren't wonderful. But Dad slugs ketchup straight from the bottle, Mum is obsessed with Masterchef, and Grandma likes to wear her new bikini around the house.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>星期五晚餐 第一季</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>6</li><li><span>集数: </span>6</li><li><span>开始: </span>2011-02-25</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>30分钟</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt1844923</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"英剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":294977,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/294977","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":294978,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/294978","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":294979,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/294979","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":294980,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/294980","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":294981,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/294981","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":294982,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/294982","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
