Notably, grenades are thrown by pressing the option button to switch, then fire. This was changed in the sequel. When the game is completed once, another character becomes playable. There are five different difficulty levels: kids, easy, normal, hard, and very hard.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>合金弹头：第一任务</li><li><span>别名: </span>メタルスラッグ ファーストミッション</li><li><span>平台: </span>NGPC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>开发: </span>SNK</li><li><span>游戏出版商: </span>SNK</li><li><span>发行: </span>SNK</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1999-05-27</li>","collection":{"collect":9},"relations":[{"id":9949,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/96/59/9949_obckn.jpg","title":"メタルスラッグ セカンドミッション","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/9949"},{"id":9938,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/2b/9b/9938_8s8HG.jpg","title":"メタルスラッグ","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/9938"}]}
