It was released worldwide on April 20, 2010 as an exclusive title for iOS. Produced by Takehiro Ando, characters were designed by Yusuke Naora, the art director of Final Fantasy VII, VIII, and X among other successful titles.\r\nThe game takes place in a mysterious place known as Ark Arena, where participants face enemies in both dungeons and tournament-play to avoid death and gain immortality. Chaos Rings features four scenarios. Each scenario is played by two different story characters and across several worlds, ending with a boss battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nChaos Rings begins as a dungeon crawl where navigation and battles are done as a two-person party that is chosen prior to gameplay. Navigation takes place in a third-person perspective. Combat is controlled using a system of menus in a turn-based routine. During a player's turn there is the option of attempting an escape from the battle, or to fight solo or as a pair. If solo mode is chosen, the player has the ability to choose an individual attack for each member of the party, while pair mode effectively makes the couple a single unit, capable of using each other's moves and having the best attributes of both. However, when in pair mode, both members of the party are open to a hit by a single enemy. In addition to attack, the player also has the ability to perform varied forms of magic known as \"genes\", to use items, or to simply defend against an enemy's attack.\r\nA special feature in combat is the 'break' feature. Attacks made by the couple will decrease the break gauge if it is red (and thus on the enemies' side), and will increase their own if the attack kills a foe. When the break gauge favors one side, their attacks are more powerful, and the foe's are likewise weakened. Critical hits and the ability Trompe L'oell deplete the break gauge at twice the rate of a regular attack.\r\nAfter a successful battle, the duo receives experience points and Ohnz (abbreviated as \"Oz\"). Ohnz are the currency in Ark Arena, and can be used to purchase items, weapons, armor, and jewels.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>混沌之戒</li><li><span>开发: </span>Media.Vision、<a href=\"/person/33252\">メディア・ビジョン</a></li><li><span>发行: </span>Apple、<a href=\"/person/497\">スクウェア・エニックス</a></li><li><span>剧本: </span><a href=\"/person/7024\">北島行徳</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/3064\">上松範康</a></li><li><span>背景: </span><a href=\"/person/17517\">塩澤良憲</a>、<a href=\"/person/27305\">美峰</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>CHAOS RINGS</li><li><span>平台: </span>Windows Phone</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PSV</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2010-04-20</li><li><span>售价: </span>1,500円</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://dlgames.square-enix.com/chaosrings/jp/index.html</li><li><span>游戏出版商: </span>Square Enix</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Takehiro Ando</li>","collection":{"on_hold":3,"dropped":3,"wish":11,"collect":48,"doing":2},"tags":[{"name":"RPG","count":15},{"name":"PSV","count":8},{"name":"IOS","count":8},{"name":"SquareEnix","count":8},{"name":"手游","count":5},{"name":"混沌之戒","count":4},{"name":"混沌之戒系列","count":4},{"name":"脑洞","count":3},{"name":"CHAOSRINGS","count":3},{"name":"回合制","count":2},{"name":"iPhone","count":2},{"name":"2010","count":2},{"name":"太空航行","count":1},{"name":"幻想","count":1},{"name":"SE","count":1},{"name":"日本","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":497,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/e6/d9/497_prsn_z3Upo.jpg","name":"スクウェア・エニックス","desc":"发行"},{"id":33252,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/69/55/33252_prsn_XV71y.jpg","name":"メディア・ビジョン","desc":"开发"},{"id":7024,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/f4/f3/7024_prsn_lkCL8.jpg","name":"北島行徳","desc":"剧本"},{"id":3064,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/d4/ce/3064_prsn_5XTe2.jpg","name":"上松範康","desc":"音乐"},{"id":17517,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/0e/61/17517_prsn_trHzE.jpg","name":"塩澤良憲","desc":"背景"},{"id":27305,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/22/53/27305_prsn_5JruV.jpg","name":"美峰","desc":"背景"}],"relations":[{"id":115545,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/42/70/115545_56954.jpg","title":"ケイオスリングスⅢ","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/115545"},{"id":37219,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/98/00/37219_fX1X6.jpg","title":"ケイオスリングス II","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/37219"},{"id":79033,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a9/8a/79033_8DDqT.jpg","title":"Chaos Rings Ω","type":"资料片、外传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/79033"},{"id":343279,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a3/6f/343279_qQlnJ.jpg","title":"ケイオスリングス","type":"书籍","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/343279"}],"like":[{"id":10343,"name":"jubeat plus","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/8a/e7/10343_4RstD.jpg"},{"id":1916,"name":"轩辕剑三外传：天之痕","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/65/fc/1916_11dSV.jpg"},{"id":260,"name":"英雄传说6：空之轨迹FC","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a4/f2/260_37hLU.jpg"},{"id":343,"name":"英雄传说6：空之轨迹SC","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3a/d7/343_Pb22f.jpg"},{"id":40,"name":"仙剑奇侠传","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d6/45/40_rQawC.jpg"},{"id":1654,"name":"轩辕剑三 云和山的彼端","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9d/26/1654_3TV6i.jpg"},{"id":2227,"name":"osu!","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ef/df/2227_870yo.jpg"},{"id":1573,"name":"女神侧身像","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a1/af/1573_PnO22.jpg"}]}
