However, the team is desperately trying to fund it and failing, mostly because of the bad rep generated by the demise of Pied Piper's compression platform and associated clickfarm upticks. After clashing with Dinesh and Gilfoyle over the development of the app and making a last-ditch attempt to get Russ Hanneman to fund it, Richard realizes that he can't go on being the CEO of a project he doesn't believe in. Just as the team prepares to replace him with Big Head, he quits his position and equity to use his algorithm and the Pied Piper brand in the pursuit of a more ambitious goal: a new, decentralized and free internet based on users and smartphones and not companies and mainframes. Having created the software, he suggests Dinesh become the CEO of PiperChat, even if Jared is heartbroken by Richard leaving. Meanwhile, Gavin Belson and Jack Barker are returning from China after closing a deal to manufacture Hooli Endframe's box there. Jack asks for their private jet to be diverted to fly him to Jackson Hole, which is completely out of the way of Gavin's destination at Moffett Field. Jack then acts like a slob on the plane. An enraged Belson \"promotes\" Jack by assigning him a position at a desk in Hooli's data center, deep underground.","status":"Air"},{"id":711786,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/711786","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Terms of Service","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2017-04-30","comment":0,"desc":"PiperChat is gathering attention from investors and a steady stream of daily active users, while Richard keeps working on his \"new internet\" project. When he asks Dinesh for access to PiperChat's data repository, Dinesh informs him that he has blocked him out, as well as all former employees, which breaks their verbal agreement. A sympathetic Big Head secretly gives him his login access, and Richard finds out that the main users of PiperChat are children, since the app's terms of service never included a clause that prevented them from using the app and Dinesh never bothered to port Pied Piper's terms of service to PiperChat. This violates the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and can incur in a potential penalty of $21 billion. Meanwhile Jack Barker has an apparent positive reaction to his demotion to the data center underground, but Gavin Belson thinks he is up to something and seeks to spy on his video chat sessions. Since Barker uses PiperChat, the only way to do this is to acquire the company. Accusing him of stealing Hooli Chat's tech and threatening with a lawsuit, Gavin Belson calls Dinesh to take PiperChat from him, oblivious of its legal problems. Dinesh, who planned to shut down the app all along, happily agrees.","status":"Air"},{"id":711787,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/711787","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Intellectual Property","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2017-05-07","comment":0,"desc":"In the disastrous aftermath of the acquisition of PiperChat, Gavin Belson is fired and replaced with Jack Barker, who has found a way to prevent Hooli from paying the penalty from COPPA. Having learned that Jian-Yang's app is actually about octopus recipes and not Oculus VR, Erlich hopelessly watches as he tries to pitch it to Coleman Blair Partners. During the meeting, Erlich manages to convince them that the app is like a \"Shazam for food,\" a concept that Raviga ends up investing in, as Monica, eager to see Laurie's new right hand man Ed Chen fail, captures his attention by faking a phone call near him. This backfires when, after a dinner with Jian-Yang and Erlich, Chen finds out that they don't have a working demo and retires from the project, suggesting that Monica be put in charge of it. Erlich recruits Dinesh and Gilfoyle to help him build the non-existent app, refusing help from Big Head. Big Head, under pressure from his father to do something, applies to Stanford University but is rejected based on his mediocre transcript (showing five years at Arizona State without graduating). Once the admissions officer realizes who Big Head is, thanks to his Hooli promotions and media exposure, he ends up being invited to be a guest lecturer at Stanford's Department of Computer Science. Dinesh dates a hacker, Mia, who is impressed with his takedown of Gavin. Mia, as it turns out, knows Gilfoyle from his online persona and also hates him. Meanwhile, Richard is obsessively thinking about his decentralized internet project and close to a breakthrough. After Monica tells him that the late Peter Gregory dedicated a lot of his time to a similar concept, Richard accesses Gregory's archives. Even though Richard is excited that Gregory achieved some of the same conclusions as he did and that his notes will save him a lot of work, Jared finds out that the whole concept was patented in the name of Hooli years ago, when Gregory was founding the company in a garage with Gavin Belson and others. Richard is enraged, but ends up seeking Belson to meet with him.","status":"Air"},{"id":711788,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/711788","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Teambuilding Exercise","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2017-05-14","comment":1,"desc":"Gavin is initially reluctant to build Richard's idea, but seeing as it will render Hooli's servers (and Jack Barker's Hooli Endframe box) obsolete, he agrees. Knowing that the guys would never work for Gavin, he assembles a team of people outside the incubator to assemble the platform, but ends up adding Gilfoyle and Jared, who admit they want to be in the team. Jian-Yang tests his Seefood app, but it only works for recognizing if a food is a hotdog or not. Erlich, realizing that the app will only work properly if thousands of pictures of food from the internet are checked manually, convinces Big Head to make his students do this instead of their regular assignment, which is watching technology-related movies in class. However, they meet with Coleman Blair Partners and create their own food based app, rendering Seefood useless. Predicting that the app will fail to be funded, Erlich trades his equity for a Corvette Jian-Yang bought with the rest of the initial funding money. However, Jian-Yang manages to pivot the project as a filter for 'dick pics' and Periscope acquires the app for $4 million. Dinesh, who, thanks to Gilfoyle's remarks, is starting to get paranoid about his new girlfriend, is still the app's main programmer, and ends scrubbing pictures of penises from the internet as his main duty.","status":"Air"},{"id":711789,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/711789","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"The Blood Boy","name_cn":"","duration":"30min","airdate":"2017-05-21","comment":0,"desc":"As Richard presents the business plan for the decentralized internet project, he almost convinces Gavin to have a discreet, under-the-radar launch, but Bryce, a jock who regularly donates his blood to Belson and is present at the meeting, influences Gavin to have them rethink their entire launch strategy. After the meeting, a furious Richard and an enraged Jared warn Bryce not to interfere with their company. Gavin demands that Richard apologizes, and he visits Bryce, eventually discovering that he actually consumes marijuana and sugary snacks and is not as healthy as Gavin thinks he is. Meanwhile, Erlich correctly predicts that Ed Chen is planning to force Laurie out of Raviga. When Monica tries to warn her, Laurie says she knew about this all along, rewarding Monica's loyalty with an invitation to be her partner on a new VC fund, as she always had planned to exit Raviga. Dinesh is paranoid about what his girlfriend Mia can do to him if she finds out that he didn't end Gavin's career at Hooli on purpose. For this reason, he doesn't have the courage to break up with her. When Mia reveals to Dinesh that she has hacked access to the elevators at the Freedom Tower in New York City, he calls the FBI who have Mia arrested. After this, he offers Richard his services. Having found out that Bryce was not only a corporate spy but also had high cholesterol, a disillusioned Gavin decides to leave Palo Alto, handing Richard full ownership of the decentralized internet patent.","status":"Air"},{"id":711790,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/711790","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Customer Service","name_cn":"","duration":"30min","airdate":"2017-05-28","comment":4,"desc":"Russ Hanneman visits the incubator and angrily confronts Richard for presenting Gavin Belson with the decentralized internet idea, which Russ considers he co-owns. Richard still tries to get Russ to fund them, but he urinates inside Erlich's yellow Corvette before leaving. After this, Richard decides to skip trying to convince investors and go directly to the customers, presenting the project to companies so they buy the product even if it's not built yet. After several meetings that fail because all the valley knows Gavin Belson has jumped ship, they present their idea to Liz, Head of Compliance at insurance company FGI whose CTO, and Liz's fiancée, is Dan Melcher, who punched Erlich at Tech Crunch disrupt after he slept with his two former wives. Richard keeps Erlich at bay so that he doesn't put the deal at risk by seducing Liz, but ends up having sex with her during a late night meeting. Unaware of this, Melcher informs him that the deal will go ahead. Meanwhile, Erlich inadvertently crashes into a tech meeting with Keenan Feldspar, whose VR headset is the valley's latest sensation. Having previously failed to convince Monica and Laurie to hire him at their new VC company Bream-Hall, he uses Feldspar and his promising tech as leverage to get a job with them.","status":"Air"},{"id":711791,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/711791","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"The Patent Troll","name_cn":"","duration":"30min","airdate":"2017-06-04","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":711792,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/711792","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"The Keenan Vortex","name_cn":"","duration":"30min","airdate":"2017-06-11","comment":1,"desc":"Due to a wave of unusually cold weather and consequent insurance claims, FGI faces a lot more data processing requirements than Pied Piper is expected to handle, and the team is facing an astronomical bill from their data storage center provider for the sudden spike. Richard decides to attract investment from another client to handle this, approaching Erlich so that he gets Keenan Feldspar to hear their pitch. Richard thinks Feldspar's VR tech is a fad, but Dinesh and Gilfoyle are so impressed after trying it that they integrate Pied Piper's middle out algorithm into Feldspar's VR, which improves it greatly. As a result Feldspar offers to acquire Pied Piper altogether. Richard doesn't want this, so he counters with an offer of $25 million, which Keenan still accepts. Richard intends to concede, but Monica warns him that Feldspar's VR isn't that great and that he's walking into a trap, promising that she will fund their series A round if they can implement the decentralized internet project on a sufficient number of cell phones. After texting him telling him the deal is off, Richard learns that Feldspar has signed with Hooli, abandoning Erlich in the process.

After running into his ex-girlfriend Winnie, who is presenting her boyfriend's app, Richard sabotages their laptop's screensaver, which triggers a 'tactical response team' sent by Hoover, Hooli's head of security. He tries to warn Jack Barker that Pied Piper is up to something, but is violently dismissed and threatened to be fired. After Hoover finally catches Dinesh and Gilfoyle red-handed on CCTV, he lets them go as Richard once collaborated with Gavin Belson to hinder Jack Barker's plans at Hooli and he sympathizes with this. Pied Piper finally gets installed on a sufficient number of phones, which allows Richard to move all of FGI's data into the app, eliminating the need for an auxiliary data server and its related costs. The high point of the event sees Jack Barker and Keenan Feldspar presenting their VR mobile tech to the world, but it fails miserably and causes Hooli phones all over the auditorium to explode. Meanwhile, Erlich decides to accept Gavin Belson's invitation (originally addressed to Richard and company but taking \"and company\" literally) to come and join him at a monastery in Tibet, to Belson's shock.","status":"Air"},{"id":711794,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/711794","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Server Error","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"After the incident with the exploding Hooli phones at Hooli-Con, Jack Barker intends to replace all 9 million affected devices, instead of just releasing a firmware update, an exceedingly expensive plan that goes against the wishes of the Hooli board. This puts Pied Piper in risk of breaching contract with FGI, as the cell phone network where the data is stored will effectively be eliminated. Richard decides to use 'Anton', Pied Piper's server, to store the data, even if this will exceed its capacity and probably destroy it. Barker heads to China and tries to force the Hooli plant workers to increase production. As a result, he is taken hostage until they get better wages and work environment. Gavin Belson, who is in Tibet, learns about this through Erlich and sees an opportunity. Before heading to China to rescue Jack, he ditches Erlich and hands a Tibetan local enough cash for Erlich to stay at his place for the next 5 years. He then rescues Barker and leaves him in Jackson Hole before being reinstated as Hooli's CEO by the Hooli board. Meanwhile, after the broadband service at the incubator is cut due to lack of payment, Richard plans to connect Anton to Stanford Tech's server cluster, using Big Head's position there to do so. When they arrive, they discover that the back of the truck wasn't closed and Anton's parts have been scattered all over the road. At the same time, Melcher frantically tries to contact Richard. When they head to FGI to face him, the team are surprised to find that, before shutting down, Anton backed itself up to Jian-Yang's smart refrigerator, as Gilfoyle used some of the Pied Piper code when he was trying to hack it, which in turn connected itself to a network of other refrigerators like it, distributing the data and proving the decentralized internet is a working concept. Melcher attacks Richard, as he finally found out that Richard had sex with his fiancée after she accidentally told him about it. Pied Piper is again sought by investors all over the Valley. Gavin Belson offers a very generous acquisition deal to Richard, who turns it down and decides to be funded by Bream/Hall. Gavin threatens to devour Pied Piper, but Richard answers back, promising to render the entire physical server rental business, and Hooli itself, obsolete.","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":38628,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/04/49/38628_prsn_MOomu.jpg","name":"HBO电视网","desc":"制作"}],"relations":[{"id":180774,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a6/09/180774_fsIdi.jpg","title":"Silicon Valley (Season 3)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/180774"},{"id":215876,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c8/a6/215876_AVEVP.jpg","title":"Silicon Valley Season 5","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/215876"}]}
