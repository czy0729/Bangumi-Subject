Wanting to reach new players by creating an enhanced version of one of its older games, in June 2003 Sega released Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut, a port of Sonic Adventure for the GameCube and Windows. While mostly identical to the original release, Sonic Adventure DX features updated graphics, including higher-resolution textures and more detailed character models, has a locked frame rate of 60, and sports a redesigned Chao-raising system that uses connectivity with the Game Boy Advance (GBA). It includes 60 new missions and the option to unlock all 12 Sonic games released for the Game Gear. Additionally, Metal Sonic can be unlocked as a playable character if all 130 emblems are collected. These features were added to appeal to players of the original game.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>索尼克大冒险DX</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ソニックアドベンチャーDX</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Sonic Adventure DX</li><li><span>平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003年6月17日</li>","collection":{"collect":10,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":4},{"name":"索尼克","count":2},{"name":"SEGA","count":2},{"name":"ACT","count":1}],"crt":[{"id":75332,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/79/48/75332_crt_d04ZO.jpg","name":"索尼克","desc":"主角"}],"staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":54818,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/04/85/54818_y0j3V.jpg","title":"Sonic Adventure","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/54818"}]}
