The player can choose one of five different characters to play as, each bearing unique attributes such as height, speed, and endurance. Its remake was designed by Interceptor Entertainment and released by Apogee Games in 2013. The shareware version of the game is titled, Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins.\r\n\r\nThe game began as a follow-up game to the Wolfenstein 3D, but was soon altered and became a stand-alone game. It includes both single-player and multi-player functions, allowing individuals to connect with other gamers and tackle missions as a team.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>龙霸三合会</li><li><span>开发: </span>Apogee Software (<a href=\"/person/40109\">3D Realms</a>)</li><li><span>发行: </span>Apogee Software (<a href=\"/person/40109\">3D Realms</a>)</li><li><span>关卡设计: </span><a href=\"/person/39861\">Tom Hall</a></li><li><span>导演: </span><a href=\"/person/39861\" rel=\"v:directedBy\">Tom Hall</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Rise of the Triad: Dark War</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins</li><li><span>平台: </span>DOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年12月21日(shareware)</li>","staff":[{"id":40109,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/12/47/40109_prsn_c6hmU.jpg","name":"3D Realms","desc":"开发"},{"id":39861,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6e/63/39861_prsn_BzuQV.jpg","name":"汤姆·霍尔","desc":"关卡设计"}],"relations":[{"id":334732,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5a/0e/334732_uU4Mg.jpg","title":"Rise of the Triad","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/334732"}]}
