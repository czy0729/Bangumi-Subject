{"id":334728,"type":4,"name":"Doom RPG","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/28/16/334728_zUNPB.jpg","summary":"DOOM comes to mobile devices as a first-person turn-based role playing game, co-developed by John Carmack. It incorporates many elements of the original game, but was designed with the limitations of the platform in mind. Instead of giving complete freedom, you move in steps and turn by 90 degrees. You can move as fast as you want, but when a monster appears, the game becomes completely turn-based, both for movement and attacks.\r\n\r\nYou are a space marine dispatched to a UAC research facility where a distress call was sent out. You start with a limited amount of health, armor and weapons. As you progress and kill monsters, you gain experience and level up to improve health, strength and agility. When engaging in a fight, hits are determined by your statistics, the type of enemy and the weapon you are currently using. Each enemy has a weapon weakness. You can also collect credits to buy upgrades at computer terminals and talk to characters. The story is revealed through conversations with characters and scripted sequences.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>毁灭战士RPG</li><li><span>程序: </span><a href=\"/person/36789\">John Carmack</a></li><li><span>制作人: </span><a href=\"/person/36789\">John Carmack</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Java ME</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>BREW</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>BlackBerry</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2005年9月13日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Fountainhead Entertainment</li><li><span>发行: </span>JAMDAT Mobile</li>","staff":[{"id":36789,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/70/09/36789_prsn_JfgKv.jpg","name":"约翰·卡马克","desc":"程序"}],"relations":[{"id":334729,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/7a/28/334729_77Rty.jpg","title":"Doom II RPG","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/334729"},{"id":50267,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/59/84/50267_7uNQ6.jpg","title":"DOOM","type":"主线故事","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/50267"}]}
