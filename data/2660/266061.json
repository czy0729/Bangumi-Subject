It was originally conceived as a multiplayer-focused third game in the Deus Ex series, Deus Ex: Clan Wars, but after the less than expected commercial performance of Deus Ex: Invisible War, it was decided to set the game in its own universe. Nevertheless, it remains a spiritual sequel to Deus Ex and retains many visible and conceptual links to its progenitors.\r\nIn Project: Snowblind, the player assumes the identity of Nathan Frost, a soldier in an international peacekeeping force known as the Liberty Coalition. After being critically injured during an enemy attack, Frost is implanted with experimental nano-technological augmentations and enhancements, turning him into \"the soldier of the future\". Frost must use his new powers to help lead the Coalition to victory against overwhelming odds.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>雪盲计划</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/18533\">Crystal Dynamics</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17043\">Eidos Interactive</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Project: Snowblind</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2005年2月22日</li>","staff":[{"id":18533,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/65/42/18533_prsn_12e27.jpg","name":"晶体动力","desc":"开发"},{"id":17043,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/3c/71/17043_prsn_U3DbI.jpg","name":"艺夺","desc":"发行"}]}
