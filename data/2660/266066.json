Its theme is to build galactic civilizations via game cards that represent worlds or technical and social developments. It accommodates 2-4 players by default although expansions allow for up to 6 players, as well as solo play. The game uses iconography in place of language in some places, with complex powers also having a text description. While appreciated by experienced players for being concise, some new players find the icons difficult to learn and decipher.\r\nThe game won Boardgamegeek's Golden Geek Award for best card game, Fairplay Magazine’s À la carte award for best card game of 2008, and was described by the magazine Tric Trac as \"LE jeu de cartes de cette année 2008\" (THE card game of the year 2008).","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>银河竞逐</li><li><span>别名: </span>银河竞赛</li><li><span>平台: </span>桌游</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Card game</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>2 - 4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2007年(桌游), 2017年5月3日(iOS)</li><li><span>发行: </span>Rio Grande Games</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"relations":[{"id":313491,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/57/ca/313491_3t1Zs.jpg","title":"Roll for the Galaxy","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/313491"}]}
