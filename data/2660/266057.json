The game started out as a Kickstarter campaign in 2013. The goal of Star Realms is to destroy your opponent or opponents by purchasing cards using \"trade\" points and using these cards to attack your opponent's \"authority\" using your \"combat\" points. The game takes place in a distant future where different races compete to gain resources, trade and outmaneuver each other in a race to become ruler of the galaxy.\r\nStar Realms is similar to other deck building games, like Ascension and Dominion. The game is marketed as portable and expandable, as it comes in a small box and contains only cards and no dice or markers.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>星际王国</li><li><span>别名: </span>星域奇航</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>星域</li><li><span>平台: </span>桌游</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Deck-building game</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>2 - 4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2014年(桌游), 2014年8月13日(iOS)</li><li><span>发行: </span>White Wizard Games</li>"}
