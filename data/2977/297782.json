However, this co-existence is anything but peaceful, since android are going rampant, and a special police force known as ACP (\"Anti Criminal-cyborg Police\") is specifically assigned to deal with them. Two young and lovely police officers, Angelica and Apple, receive a S.O.S. signal from two army pilots, who were attacked by a mysterious female cyborg who called herself Patricia von Kreuzel. Upon arriving at the crime scene, the heroines find no survivors. Together with their colleague, a young detective named Keith, they must investigate and solve this case.","info":"<li><span>原画: </span><a href=\"/person/14608\">林家志弦</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ＨＨＧ ハートヒートガールズ</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC98</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS+P&C式ADV</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993-12-02</li><li><span>ブランド: </span>Cat's Pro.</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":3},"staff":[{"id":14608,"image":"","name":"林家志弦","desc":"原画"}]}
