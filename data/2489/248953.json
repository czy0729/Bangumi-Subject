The game recycles content from the original Mega Man for NES and its sequel, Mega Man 2. At the start of the game, only four Robot Master stages are available to choose, all of which are from Mega Man. The second four Robot Masters, all of which are from Mega Man 2, are fought as bosses in the Wily Castle. This would become a staple of the Game Boy games until Mega Man V, the only Mega Man game for Game Boy not to recycle large amounts of content from the NES games.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>洛克人世界</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ROCKMAN WORLD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge</li><li><span>平台: </span>GB</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>3DS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1991年7月26日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"Platform","count":1},{"name":"GB","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1},{"name":"Capcom","count":1}],"crt":[{"id":63836,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ff/01/63836_crt_U6m6c.jpg","name":"洛克人","desc":"主角"}],"staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":248954,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/de/85/248954_S4s45.jpg","title":"ロックマンワールド2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/248954"},{"id":82758,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/bf/d8/82758_kTT2k.jpg","title":"ロックマン","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/82758"}]}
