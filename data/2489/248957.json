The game has Super Game Boy support. At one time it was considered to be rereleased in 2000, but unlike Mega Man II, the project was abandoned. Unlike previous Game Boy titles, the game did not reuse levels or bosses from the NES titles, but is a completely new game with its own storyline, new assets and a full series of new bosses and weapons. This game marked the introduction of the Stardroids. This game is currently available for download on the 3DS Nintendo eShop.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>洛克人世界5</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ROCKMAN WORLD 5</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Mega Man V</li><li><span>平台: </span>GB</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>3DS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年7月22日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"Platform","count":1},{"name":"GB","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1},{"name":"Capcom","count":1}],"crt":[{"id":63836,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ff/01/63836_crt_U6m6c.jpg","name":"洛克人","desc":"主角"},{"id":63426,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/2b/17/63426_crt_JlyyB.jpg","name":"罗露","desc":"配角"}],"staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":248956,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6a/e4/248956_OzQGB.jpg","title":"ロックマンワールド4","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/248956"}]}
