Mega Man III uses content from its NES counterpart, Mega Man 3, as well as from Mega Man 4. Following its predecessors for Game Boy, there are only four Robot Masters available to choose at the start of the game, all of which are from Mega Man 3. An additional four Robot Masters are accessible once the first four are completed, the latter all coming from Mega Man 4. Mega Man III also adds some additional features first seen in Mega Man 4, including the ability to charge the Mega Buster to release a charged shot, as well as Eddie appearing in certain stages, dispensing a random aid item.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>洛克人世界3</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ROCKMAN WORLD 3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Mega Man III</li><li><span>平台: </span>GB</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>3DS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年12月11日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"Platform","count":1},{"name":"GB","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1},{"name":"Capcom","count":1}],"crt":[{"id":63836,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ff/01/63836_crt_U6m6c.jpg","name":"洛克人","desc":"主角"}],"staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":248954,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/de/85/248954_S4s45.jpg","title":"ロックマンワールド2","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/248954"},{"id":248956,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6a/e4/248956_OzQGB.jpg","title":"ロックマンワールド4","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/248956"}]}
