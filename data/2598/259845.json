By default, Player 1 and Player 2 can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled. Along with the ship's primary weapons, the player also has access to three bombs: one that can make a wave of fire that starts from behind the player's ship and scrolls \"up\" the screen, one that makes a powerful circular, nova-like blast, and one that shoots several mini-missiles capable of homing in on multiple targets. The game has six stages.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>视点战机</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/7485\">サミー</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Viewpoint</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>得分王</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>视角</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Neo Geo</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Neo Geo CD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>X68000</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Isometric shooter</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年11月20日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Aicom</li>","staff":[{"id":7485,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/8e/62/7485_prsn_9p3Vz.jpg","name":"Sammy","desc":"发行"}]}
