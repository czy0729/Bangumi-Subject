Hackers were able to create bootleg Neo-Geo cartridges by extracting the rom (which never surfaced on the internet until then) from the Wii release.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超铁战机</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/705\">SNK</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Ironclad</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Chotetsu Brikin'ger</li><li><span>平台: </span>Neo Geo CD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii VC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>横版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996年9月20日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Saurus</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARC","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":705,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a5/82/705_prsn_o7m1w.jpg","name":"SNK","desc":"发行"}]}
