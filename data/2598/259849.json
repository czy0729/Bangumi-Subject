{"id":259849,"type":4,"name":"Judgement Silversword: Rebirth Edition","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/93/60/259849_tIeeE.jpg","summary":"Two classic Wonderswan games, now on PC! Battle the mysterious Judges in Judgement Silversword. Cardinal Sins is a score trial marathon, based on the theme of the Seven Deadly Sins. Will you face Judgement?\r\nJudgement Silversword is the winner of the \"WonderWitch\" 2001 game development contest, and was originally released in 2004. Designed for the WonderSwan Color, Judgement Silversword has the unique distinction of being one of the few shooting games designed for a handheld console, and it's also one of the best! Destroying enemies as quickly as possible is essential to scoring in Judgement Silversword, giving the game a ruthless tempo. One of indie developer M-KAI's first games, it can be seen as the inspiration and predecessor to the gameplay ideas in Eschatos.\r\nCardinal Sins puts an interesting twist on shoot 'em up gameplay with a score trial marathon spanning 7 different areas, each with a unique objective themed around the 7 Deadly Sins. Collect lives in Sloth, Hoard enemy data in Greed, and avoid Destruction at the hands of Wrath. Mastering the different objectives gives the game a great sense of variety. Getting an S rank in every trial is very challenging!","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>裁决银剑</li><li><span>别名: </span>JUDGEMENT SILVERSWORD - Resurrection -</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Judgement Silversword: Resurrection</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>裁决银剑：重生</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>审判银剑</li><li><span>平台: </span>WSC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>纵版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2004年2月2日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Qute</li><li><span>发行: </span>M-Kai</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":1}}
