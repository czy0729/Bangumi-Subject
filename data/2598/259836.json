It was released in Japanese arcades in April 2003 on Sega NAOMI hardware, and was ported to the Dreamcast later that year. The story takes place in the future where humans are defending their Mars colony from an invading alien attack. The game employs a \"border system\" where each stage has three variations of different difficulty. The player starts on the easiest variation, and is lowered to a more difficult variation with each subsequent loss of a life.\r\nProducer Hiroyuki Maruyama was heavily inspired by Taito's shooter Metal Black (1991) and founded G.rev with ex-Taito employees specifically to develop a shooter of his own. The team of five did subcontract work to gather funding and build their skills programming NAOMI arcade hardware. Among the projects they worked on were Treasure's Ikaruga (2001) and Gradius V (2004). Due to lack of funds, they were not able to realize all the ideas they conceptualized for the game. Border Down was released to mixed reception, but was commercially successful and continues to maintain a steady interest from shooter fans. G.rev went on to make other shoot 'em ups including Senko no Ronde and Under Defeat.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>破茧先锋</li><li><span>别名: </span>Border Down</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>DC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>横版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003年4月</li><li><span>开发: </span>グレフ</li><li><span>发行: </span>グレフ</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"波动炮","count":1},{"name":"横版射击","count":1},{"name":"DC","count":1},{"name":"射击","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}]}
