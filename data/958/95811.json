Shadow Dan, our hero's shadow, yearns for a more exciting life but happens to be stuck with Daniel Grubb, a timid guy with an extreme aversion to adventure. When a crime in the shadow world puts both of their lives in danger, Shadow Dan is forced to take control of Daniel. They go on a madcap adventure to investigate the crime and stop the shadow villain from leading a rebellion where shadows take over the human world. During this adventure, Shadow Dan empowers Daniel to let go of his fears and embrace life. Through their adventure, they both learn that one cannot be whole without a true friend.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>我和我的影子</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2015年11月25日</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>IMDb链接: </span>tt1795621</li><li><span>导演: </span>Alessandro Carloni</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Steve Bencich / Ron J.
