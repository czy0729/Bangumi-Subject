The goal of the game is to descend to the bottom of a dark dungeon known as the Devil's Bastion and destroy an undead lich named Baron Herx, who terrorized the peaceful town of Hamlet in life and is now harboring a curse against the land from beyond the grave. To aid you in your quest are friendly humans who have been eeking out a rough life within the dungeon for generations, as well as any friends you can bring with you in real life: Barony is the first of its kind as a first-person roguelike in that it fully supports cooperative multiplayer for up to four players.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1-4</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2015/6/23</li><li><span>售价: </span>$14.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.baronygame.com/</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"☆","count":1},{"name":"EPIC","count":1}]}
