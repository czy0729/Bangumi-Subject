The show is broadcast on Tokyo MX TV in Japan and across the world on various terrestrial and online networks including Animax Asia, Mnet in America and Crunchyroll.\r\n\r\nCulture Japan is directed, and produced by myself where I not only cover Japanese Pop Culture, I also introduce more of the traditional aspects of Japan too. Prepare for a menu of Otaku, Anime, Traditional, Food, Travel, Fashion and Technology. But why do I do all of this? This is why.\r\n\r\nThe show is presented by myself Danny Choo and my mascot character Mirai Suenaga.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>Culture Japan Season 2</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>土曜日</li><li><span>导演: </span><a href=\"/person/6182\" rel=\"v:directedBy\">Danny Choo</a></li><li><span>集数: </span>13</li><li><span>开始: </span>2011年10月01日</li><li><span>结束: </span>2011年12月24日</li><li><span>语言: </span>日语、英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>30分钟</li><li><span>电视台: </span>Tokyo MX</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.dannychoo.com/special/en/culturejapan</li>","collection":{"wish":5,"collect":1,"doing":4,"on_hold":3},"tags":[{"name":"SP","count":1},{"name":"日剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":128561,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/128561","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Rebuilding Japan after the 3.1","name_cn":"東北海嘯","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":132242,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/132242","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Wonderfestival with Good Smile Company","name_cn":"與Good Smile Company玩轉Wonderfestival","duration":"","airdate":"2011-10-08","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":166516,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/166516","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Japanese Festivals","name_cn":"日本慶典節日","duration":"","airdate":"2011-10-15","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":166517,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/166517","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Worldwide Anime Events","name_cn":"各國的動漫活動","duration":"","airdate":"2011-10-22","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":166518,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/166518","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Discover Otaroad with Suzuko Mimori - Part 1","name_cn":"與三森鈴子遊玩Otaroad（上）","duration":"","airdate":"2011-10-29","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":166519,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/166519","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Discover Otaroad with Suzuko Mimori - Part 2","name_cn":"與三森鈴子遊玩Otaroad（下）","duration":"","airdate":"2011-11-05","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":166520,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/166520","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"The Return to Edo Wonderland with Elly Otoguro","name_cn":"與乙黑繪理回到日光江戶村","duration":"","airdate":"2011-11-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":166521,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/166521","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Discovering Edo Wonderland with Elly Otoguro","name_cn":"與乙黑繪理探索日光江戶村","duration":"","airdate":"2011-11-19","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":166522,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/166522","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"How Anime is Made at JC Staff","name_cn":"到JC Staff瞭解動漫製作過程","duration":"","airdate":"2011-11-26","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":166523,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/166523","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Asia's Biggest Anime Event - "Anime Festival Asia" Part 1","name_cn":"亞洲最大型動漫活動 —— 亞洲動漫節（上）","duration":"","airdate":"2011-12-03","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":166524,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/166524","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Asia's Biggest Anime Event - "Anime Festival Asia" Part 2","name_cn":"亞洲最大型動漫活動 —— 亞洲動漫節（下）","duration":"","airdate":"2011-12-10","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":166525,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/166525","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Discovering Asakusa","name_cn":"探索淺草","duration":"","airdate":"2011-12-17","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":166526,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/166526","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"The Making of Culture Japan","name_cn":"《Culture Japan》製作花絮","duration":"","airdate":"2011-12-24","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"crt":[{"id":14618,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/69/91/14618_crt_7DHN8.jpg","name":"末永未来","desc":"客串"}],"staff":[{"id":6182,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/f2/4c/6182_prsn_Ao7NO.jpg","name":"丹尼・周","desc":"导演"}],"relations":[{"id":25563,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a7/f6/25563_y8VKV.jpg","title":"Culture Japan Season 1","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/25563"}]}
