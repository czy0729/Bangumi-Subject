{"id":330311,"type":4,"name":"Ground Control II: Operation Exodus","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a5/9c/330311_tTw2S.jpg","summary":"Ground Control II: Operation Exodus takes place during the year 2741 AD, roughly 300 years after the events in the original game.\r\n\r\nThe democratic and freedom caring Northern Star Alliance (NSA) is being hard pressed by the warmongering Terran Empire. The war has recently entered a new stage; a brutal and deadly ground war, as the Empire has managed to land their first troopships on the last NSA controlled planet — Morningstar Prime.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jacob Angelus, a battle-hardened officer in the NSA armed forces, finds himself becoming the central figure in the war against the Terran Empire. The situation is desperate and for the NSA destiny is at hand; its only hope lies in an ancient legend.\r\n\r\nGround Control II hasn’t conformed to the standard format of “base-building” RTS games. There’s no technical upgrade tree, and no mining for gold, crystals, or any other random mineral to be used as a monetary source. You acquire new units by spending “acquisition points” which collect throughout the battle. If you have a large battle force, the points will come in very slowly. While your army is small, the points will come in at faster rate. You can earn more points by destroying enemy units, or by capturing special locations called “victory locations.” Additional units are called in via drop ship. These drop ships will land in designated landing zones. The player must hold at least one of these landing zones in order to receive these reinforcements. You may also spend acquisition points on drop ship upgrades. These upgrades include more cargo space, speed, fuel capacity, armor, and weapons.\r\n\r\n简介来自 https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/ground-control-ii-operation-exodus","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>地面控制2：大撤退</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/39061\">Massive Entertainment</a> AB</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/31207\">Sierra Entertainment</a>、奥美电子（中国大陆）、<a href=\"/person/8017\">サイバーフロント</a>（CyberFront Corporation）（日本）、<a href=\"/person/35935\">Rebellion</a> Developments（Steam）</li><li><span>别名: </span>Ground Control 2: Операция \"Исход\"</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>地面控制2：撤离行动</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>地面控制2：撤离计划</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>地面控制2：脱逃计划</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RTS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2004年6月23日（欧美）</li><li><span>其他发行日期: </span>中国大陆：2004年9月3日</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">其他发行日期: </span>日本：2005年2月25日</li><li><span>制作人: </span>Martin Walfisz、Carl Fransson</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Henrik Sebring、Martin Walfisz</li>","staff":[{"id":39061,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/02/7a/39061_prsn_hX5HO.jpg","name":"Massive Entertainment","desc":"开发"},{"id":8017,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b0/2d/8017_prsn_PFtyE.jpg","name":"サイバーフロント","desc":"发行"},{"id":31207,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a6/cd/31207_prsn_v4z4M.jpg","name":"雪乐山公司","desc":"发行"},{"id":35935,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/39/cc/35935_prsn_8e55D.jpg","name":"Rebellion","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":330310,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3a/48/330310_INZyL.jpg","title":"Ground Control","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/330310"}]}
