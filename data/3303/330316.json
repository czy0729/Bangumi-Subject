{"id":330316,"type":4,"name":"Guitar Hero III Mobile","summary":"The first mobile release in the Guitar Hero franchise uses the same note-matching concept from the console versions, but with a few changes. While there is a combo system and a rock meter to keep track of the player's performance, only three different notes can be played (green, red and yellow). The game offers fifteen songs, taken from Guitar Hero II and Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, four guitars and three different venues, all gradually unlocked. Additional songs were offered as download packs afterwards.\r\n\r\n来自 https://www.mobygames.com/game/guitar-hero-iii-mobile","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>吉他英雄3 移动版</li><li><span>平台: </span>Symbian</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Java ME</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>MUG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2007年12月20日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Hands-On Mobile</li><li><span>发行: </span>MachineWorks Northwest</li><li><span>制作人: </span>J. J. Lechleiter</li>","relations":[{"id":330315,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/11/7b/330315_YcVzR.jpg","title":"Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/330315"},{"id":329799,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d2/15/329799_LW33D.jpg","title":"Guitar Hero II","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/329799"}]}
