Just out of spite, Gavin Belson hires all 63 coders approached by Pied Piper before the launch of his new mainframe box, a technology which his new employees don't want to work for, as it will be rendered obsolete by Pied Piper's decentralized internet. A raging Belson unassigns all of them. Jared suggests that they acquire Optimoji, a failing company, and hire their staff. They approach the company's CEO Kira, who insists that she must bring her whole staff of 30 along. Duncan, a coder and CEO of a pizza ordering app Sliceline who had been approached by Richard, runs into them and comments on Belson's low blow, something Richard and Jared didn't mention to her. They decide to hire all of her staff, but before they can Duncan moves in and acquires Optimoji, which infuriates Richard. He finds out that Sliceline is losing $5 on each pizza order. Richard ends up spending $19,000 on pizzas to accelerate their bankruptcy. Afterwards, he acquires the company and its entire coding staff of 50, minus Kira and Duncan. Trusting Monica's judgement, Laurie approves this, even if this is way over Pied Piper's payroll budget.","status":"Air"},{"id":785970,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/785970","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Reorientation","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2018-04-01","comment":1,"desc":"Richard is having trouble leading Pied Piper's massive team of coders, as he is unable to address them without feeling sick and embarrassing himself. As a result, the staff doesn't respect him and are still divided between Sliceline and Optimoji crews, both of which still wear apparel with their former companies' logos and have specific demands in regards to workplace policy and perks, to which Richard tries to cater with disastrous results. When he tries to inspire the coders, making them choose between working together or leaving, all of them, except Dinesh and Gilfoyle, abandon the premises. In response to this, Richard starts doing all the work on his own, coding on 48 hours the equivalent to 4 days' work, which inspires some of the former staff to return, after Jared reaches out to them. Unbeknownst to them, Gavin Belson's head of security has paid Jeff, one of Pied Piper's coders, to spy on the company for him. Meanwhile, Jian-Yang is trying to prove that Erlich is dead, so that he can become the owner of all his former property, including the hacker hostel and the 10% share of Pied Piper. After being sent a fake death certificate from China, he gets an enormous dead pig, which he cremates for its ashes, bringing them to court. Even if Jian-Yang can be entitled as Erlich had no living next of kin, the judge warns him that he must pay all of Erlich's considerable debts before he can claim anything, which he does. When they return home, Dinesh, Richard and Gilfoyle find out that Jian-Yang, now the owner of Erlich's incubator, has changed the lock and dumped their things on the front lawn.","status":"Air"},{"id":785971,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/785971","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Chief Operating Officer","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2018-04-08","comment":2,"desc":"Jared and Richard run into Dana, a former workmate of Jared at Hooli and now the CEO of tech company Quiver. He invites them to a party at their house, where Richard meets Ben Burkhart, Quiver's Chief Operating Officer, who confesses that things have gone stagnant with Dana and that he is excited by Richard's \"new internet\" project. Ben proposes becoming Pied Piper's new COO and Richard seriously considers this as he empathizes with him, even though Jared warns him of Ben's past unprofessional company exits. Meanwhile, Gavin Belson visits Seppen, the makers of Jian-Yang's smart fridge, and in exchange for server space, he has them suing Pied Piper because of Gilfoyle's hack job, which resulted in a video of a mime simulating fellatio being uploaded to the entire Seppen smart fridge network. Ben tells Richard that he should let Gilfoyle take the blame for it and face the consequences alone, saving the company from paying $10 million dollars in damages, even though Gilfoyle's actions had also saved Pied Piper from going bankrupt. Assuming that Richard will hire him, he shows up at the Pied Piper's HQ. Richard is displeased that Ben lied to Dana about him to facilitate his exit from Quiver. He also didn't like the way Ben would handle the Seppen issue, and he orders him to leave. Gilfoyle finds out that Seppen is illegally listening to their customers' conversations and uploading them to the cloud. Using this information, Jared manages to have them drop the charges and use Pied Piper's services in the future instead of Hooli's, saving both Gilfoyle and the company. Because of this, Richard promotes Jared to COO. The representatives from Seppen reveal that Gavin Belson forced them to sue Pied Piper. Because of this, Richard, Gilfoyle, Jared, and Dinesh realize that there is a mole in the company leaking info to Hooli.","status":"Air"},{"id":785972,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/785972","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Tech Evangelis","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2018-04-15","comment":3,"desc":"Richard convinces eight tech companies – which he dubs \"octopipers\" to everyone's dismay – to join PiperNet. Laurie manages to get K-Hole, one of the most promising gaming companies in the valley, to also join Pied Piper's portfolio, but the deal goes sour when Richard announces at a meeting with K-Hole that Deedee, CEO of gay dating app 1stSight and one of the \"octopipers\", is a Christian, something that is despised in the tech world. Deedee is relieved that everyone knows he's gay and Christian, but Richard tells him that if he sticks by his beliefs, K-Hole will never join Pied Piper. Meanwhile, Jared and Gilfoyle find out that Jeff is the one leaking info to Hooli, but instead of firing him they keep him in the company, so that Hoover doesn't know his cover was blown. Gavin Belson prepares the launch of his Box 3 but is oblivious to the fact that it will become obsolete as soon as Richard launches PiperNet. Jared finds out that Jian-Yang's Corvette, which belonged to Erlich, is still registered to Big Head. After inquiring about what happened to his partnership with Erlich, he finds out that Big Head hasn't still officially dissolved it and therefore is legally his next of kin. That means he owns all of Erlich's property and 10% of Pied Piper instead of Jian-Yang. After Richard announces that 1stSight is still on board, as his new internet should be free and open to everyone despite their beliefs, Deedee tells Richard he's joined Jian-Yang, who emptied Erlich's house and went to China to launch a copycat of Pied Piper's new internet project.","status":"Air"},{"id":785973,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/785973","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Facial Recognition","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2018-04-22","comment":2,"desc":"Laurie informs Richard that she's adding Eklow Labs, a promising A.I. company, to PiperNet. Richard doesn't like this, but he doesn't have a choice in the matter as the company has spent a great amount of Bream-Hall's $112 million dollar investment and has to use PiperNet free of charge. At Eklow Lab's HQ he meets Fiona, a humanoid robot which is connected to the company's network and overly protected by Ariel Eklow, the company's CEO. Richard ends up ranting to Fiona about his frustration with Jared, who has inadvertently upstaged him during a TV talk show, and Ariel's unhealthy connection with her. Shortly after, PiperNet is apparently sabotaged from the inside. Gilfoyle is paranoid that robots may develop a violent consciousness, but Richard finds out that it was Ariel who did it, as Fiona, who finally connected to a network on the outside, started to realize Ariel's creepy moves towards her and sent Richard several text messages begging for help. Realizing this, Ariel provoked a network crash to stop her from contacting him. Meanwhile, Gavin Belson finally realized that Pied Piper is well on its way to launch and starts having doubts about continuing on the tech business at all. Hoover recruits the help of Denpok, Belson's former guru at Hooli, and they succeed to make him change his mind, proceeding with the Box 3 launch.","status":"Air"},{"id":785974,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/785974","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Artificial Emotional Intelligence","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2018-04-29","comment":0,"desc":"Ariel Eklow has run away with Fiona, Eklow Labs' central asset. As a result, Laurie takes over as interim CEO of the company. Richard wants to launch PiperNet before Jian-Yang can finish his copycat version of the decentralized internet. When he visits Laurie to push a series B of funding, she breaks down and vomits. Feeling sorry for her, he grants her computing credits for free. Richard eventually finds out that Laurie has sold the credits to another company, as Fiona is still missing, and she doesn't need the computing power. When he angrily confronts Laurie, she expresses doubts about granting him the series B. Fiona appears on an Uber outside Pied Piper, having fled Ariel. Richard takes her to the hacker hostel and decides to bring her to Laurie in exchange for the series B. Laurie concedes, but proceeds to dismantle Fiona and sell her off for parts, seeking the highest return possible. Meanwhile, Gavin Belson is in China, seeking to accelerate the production of the Box 3. He runs into Jian-Yang's copycat company and finds out that he has found a way around Richard's patent for the decentralized internet. Jian-Yang refuses to sell his code, and Belson convinces Yao, the Box's manufacturing director, to use his political influence to force Jian-Yang to sign. When he does, Belson finds out that Yao has taken over as a buyer and will no longer work for Hooli, as he now owns a technology that will render the Box obsolete.","status":"Air"},{"id":785975,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/785975","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Initial Coin Offering","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2018-05-06","comment":2,"desc":"Having been verbally promised that they will not have to run ads or sell user data, Pied Piper is finally closing its $30 million series B with Bream-Hall. Jared finds out that the computing credits that Richard has offered Laurie have switched hands several times, gradually increasing in value to $1.6 million. Due to this, Gilfoyle proposes that Pied Piper uses an Initial Coin Offering, or ICO, to finance itself, breaking free of Bream-Hall and securing all board seats. He seeks advice from Russ Hanneman, who tells him that he did 36 ICOs, failing all but one, which could nonetheless cover all the losses. Meanwhile, Gavin Belson tries to manufacture the Box 3 in Goldbriar, North Carolina, imposing an unfair list of demands on the town to install production there. The factory ends up burning down due to the several municipal budget cuts done to accommodate the deal. Monica eventually finds out that Laurie is planning to run ads on PiperNet all along, and she warns Richard, who proposes that she leave Bream-Hall and work with Pied Piper on the ICO, which ends up failing at launch. Laurie contacts Monica to \"congratulate\" her about the ICO, seemingly unaffected by her departure, just before she meets Yao in China.","status":"Air"},{"id":785976,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/785976","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Fifty-One Percent","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2018-05-13","comment":2,"desc":"PiperNet finally launches, but two months later is close to bankruptcy because K-Hole, the most important \"Octopiper\" company, has jumped ship. When all seems lost, there is a sudden user spike. Unbeknownst to the team, Laurie and Yao are behind this, as they seek to add enough users to control 51% of the company, after which they will be able to shut it down and replace it with their own version of PiperNet. Colin, the CEO of K-Hole games, tells Richard he was fired from K-Hole by Laurie and is starting to develop a personal game which has already gathered 80,000 users, proposing that he adds them to the Pipernet. A resentful Richard dismisses him with a passion. The team finally discovers Laurie's move after Monica and Gilfoyle do some digging into the identities and locations of the PiperNet users and find out about Yao's platform from Jian-Yang, and although Gilfoyle can develop a patch to kick them off the platform, they will need to stall them for eight hours by adding as many users as possible. Richard tries to reach Colin and apologize, but he has gone camping and is unreachable, so Dinesh and Jared travel to meet him. To buy some time, Richard goes to Gavin Belson, who was informed that Hooli will be sold to Amazon due to the failure of the Box 3. He agrees to add the 40 prototypes of the Box 3 to PiperNet, slowing Laurie and Yao's progress, but he takes advantage of this to try to take over the company himself, contacting Laurie and proposing a deal that has her deleting all users from China so that Gavin gets to 51% and erases PiperNet. Richard desperately decides to offer the whole company to Gavin for free so that he doesn't delete it, catering to his ego and telling him that he actually has the skill to make it work. While a triumphant Gavin gloats to Laurie and slashes the proposal, the team adds Colin's 80,000 users to PiperNet, breaking the 51% barrier, and Gilfoyle launches his patch, locking Hooli and Yao off PiperNet. Pied Piper finally garners the attention of the valley, and moves to a huge 4 story building, anticipating the enormous demand their new internet will finally have.","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":38628,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/04/49/38628_prsn_MOomu.jpg","name":"HBO电视网","desc":"制作"}],"relations":[{"id":212543,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d4/d2/212543_K2kKv.jpg","title":"Silicon Valley Season 4","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/212543"},{"id":292423,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a6/85/292423_4vlBo.jpg","title":"Silicon Valley Season 6","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/292423"}]}
