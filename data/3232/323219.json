Its story was written by Warren Ellis.\r\n\r\nThe game uses the Karma Physics engine, allowing for interactivity with items in the game world and for ragdoll effects. Cover can also be improvised by using objects in the environment; for example, the player can flip a table to provide cover or grab a table and block a door. Over 30 weapons are available.\r\n\r\nThe game offers a multiplayer component that supports up to four players offline and eight players online; in the offline mode, human players may be substituted for CPU-controlled. There are a dozen maps and six modes, including deathmatch and king of the hill.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/31207\">Sierra Entertainment</a> (Vivendi Universal Games)</li><li><span>别名: </span>冷冬</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2005年5月11日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Swordfish Studios</li>","collection":{"wish":1},"staff":[{"id":31207,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a6/cd/31207_prsn_v4z4M.jpg","name":"雪乐山公司","desc":"发行"}]}
