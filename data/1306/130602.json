Go through psychedelic portals, solve abstract puzzles, explore grand minimal forms or race against the stars. A science-fiction experience unlike any other game.\r\n\r\nTHE DESIGN\r\nA cinematic game with stunning movie-like graphics, each chapter is visually unique and explores an original concept with completely new game mechanics.\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC\r\n60+ minutes of original soundtrack to heighten your sense of wonder. The soundtrack features a variety of genres and has been tailored to every movement on the screen. Best experienced with headphones.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHY\r\nLast Voyage is a game about space that is not about spaceships but rather what lies beyond our culture and technology. A game where you don't master a single task but rather explore a range of concepts. As a result, the levels are sometimes mysterious, and other times very direct. Sometimes completely still, and other times moving at the speed of light. While these chapters form a continuous narrative, you are constantly surprised with new ways to interact as you seamlessly transition from one chapter to another.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>最后的航程</li><li><span>别名: </span>最后的远航</li><li><span>平台: </span>IOS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>跑酷、解谜</li><li><span>售价: </span>$1.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://lastvoyage.co/</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":3,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"IOS","count":1}]}
