Within the paper-collage you can jump, run and last but certainly not least: rotate the world. Learn how to apply the physical consequences of rotation to master the many tricky situations you may encounter.\r\n\r\nYou can play a race against the clock on different levels, too, competing against previous clocked times. Your run will be recorded, as a \"Ghost\" which can be submitted, along with your time, to the global high scores online. You can download other users' Ghosts to compete with friends and strangers around the world and see who found the fastest route.\r\n\r\nFollowing the acclaim of the previously awarded prototype for And Yet It Moves, we present the full version, containing three exciting and beautiful environments and lots of new challenges.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>重力世界</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2009-04-02</li>","collection":{"wish":4,"collect":12,"doing":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":4},{"name":"PUZ","count":3},{"name":"Platform","count":2},{"name":"★★★★☆","count":1},{"name":"独立游戏","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}]}
