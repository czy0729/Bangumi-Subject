Players freely explore an intricate web of interwoven stories within a sprawling mansion.\r\nA group of strangers receive a curious invitation from the enigmatic inventor, Nikola Tesla, offering each of them the chance to make amends for their darkest wrongdoings. When the last guest arrives at Tesla’s isolated mansion laboratory, they find him dead – murdered. Disgraced Swedish detective, Gustaf Gustav, vows to find the killer amongst the other guests: a blind butler, a convicted murderer, the world’s most famous actress, Tesla’s former assistant, the son of a wealthy railroad magnate, and rival inventor Thomas Edison. But none of these people are what they seem.\r\nThe player is invisible, with freedom to follow and observe anyone in the story – or to explore the mansion for hidden clues.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>看不见的时间</li><li><span>平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2017年10月10日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://theinvisiblehours.com/</li>"}
