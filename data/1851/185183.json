Days Gone is played from a third-person perspective, in which the player can explore an open world environment. Players can use firearms, melee weapons and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures known as Freakers. A major game mechanic is Deacon's motorcycle, which is used as the player character's primary mode of transportation as well as mobile inventory.\r\n\r\nOriginally slated for a 2018 launch, Days Gone was delayed several times. The game eventually released on April 26, 2019. Upon release, it received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the open world aspect, gameplay and Sam Witwer's performance as Deacon, although the story, lack of character development and several technical issues were criticized.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>往日不再</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/15435\">Bend Studio</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1018\">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>动作冒险</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unreal Engine 4</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019-04-26</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://bendstudio.com/games/days-gone</li>","collection":{"wish":22,"collect":46,"doing":9,"on_hold":5,"dropped":13},"tags":[{"name":"PS4","count":16},{"name":"丧尸","count":6},{"name":"ACT","count":5},{"name":"2019","count":4},{"name":"PS5","count":2},{"name":"叫座不叫好","count":2},{"name":"SIE","count":2},{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"僵尸","count":2},{"name":"老戴","count":1},{"name":"剧情向沙盒","count":1},{"name":"☆","count":1},{"name":"PSV","count":1},{"name":"末日","count":1},{"name":"视频通关","count":1},{"name":"开放世界","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":15435,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/8c/6c/15435_prsn_C24Zi.jpg","name":"本德工作室","desc":"开发"},{"id":1018,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/37/28/1018_prsn_Yvv5n.jpg","name":"索尼互动娱乐","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":280909,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/21/bd/280909_sLO92.jpg","title":"Days Gone Original Soundtrack","type":"原声集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/280909"}]}
