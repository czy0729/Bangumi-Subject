{"id":52519,"type":4,"name":"MechCommander","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9c/d1/52519_99XLs.jpg","summary":"MechCommander is the second real-time tactics (RTT) video game based on FASA's BattleTech/MechWarrior franchise (though often being called a real-time strategy game), developed by FASA Interactive and distributed by MicroProse. Although it is claimed that MechCommander is the \"first Mechwarrior game of tactical command\", this is not true. Another game—BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Revenge—was released eight years earlier, and was also a game of tactical command staged in the same BattleTech universe. MechCommander was released in 1998. It had an expansion which was later combined with the original title and released as MechCommander Gold. A sequel also exists (distributed by Microsoft)—MechCommander 2. MicroProse also used many of the ideas in their 2000 Starship Troopers game.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>机甲指挥官</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/16859\">Xbox Game Studios</a>、<a href=\"/person/34931\">MicroProse</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>即时战略RTS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人 / 多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1998</li><li><span>开发: </span>FASA Interactive</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2},"staff":[{"id":16859,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/cd/16859_prsn_48aP4.jpg","name":"Xbox游戏工作室","desc":"发行"},{"id":34931,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ae/7e/34931_prsn_6p637.jpg","name":"MicroProse","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":52520,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/1b/7f/52520_kbYji.jpg","title":"MechCommander 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/52520"},{"id":149556,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/2e/3a/149556_W2ClA.jpg","title":"MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/149556"},{"id":293672,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/2d/eb/293672_yJ75Y.jpg","title":"MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/293672"},{"id":243907,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/50/2d/243907_6opa1.jpg","title":"BattleTech","type":"不同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/243907"}]}
