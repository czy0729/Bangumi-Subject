The story takes place before a fictional war (\"19XX\") as a lone pilot tries to defeat an entire army/evil organization from starting another World War, which soon escalates to a nuclear apocalypse.\r\nThis game is the 4th in a series of World War II vertical shooters published by Capcom, and is the last game in the series developed by Capcom. The previous games in the series 1942, 1943: The Battle of Midway and 1941: Counter Attack used the original Capcom System or CPS-1 and were released from 1984-1990. The CPS-2 platform used by this game allowed for a different art style from that used in previous games. It is followed by 1944: The Loop Master in 2000.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>19XX 终极战机</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ナインティーンダブルエックス ザ ウォー アゲンスト デスティニー</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>19XX The War Against Destiny</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARCADE</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996年1月</li>","collection":{"collect":7},"tags":[{"name":"1996","count":1},{"name":"ARCADE","count":1},{"name":"ARC","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1},{"name":"Capcom","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":73638,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/49/6c/73638_aaVDy.jpg","title":"1941 Couter Attack","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/73638"},{"id":293858,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/52/4c/293858_KvCZP.jpg","title":"1944 THE LOOP MASTER","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/293858"}]}
