Sparks makes up a story to explain Molly's pregnancy, with the goal of getting her to come to a contained ISEA area for testing over a couple of days. Molly goes to Kryger's trailer, but finds him gone and sees a strange symbol, shaped as an Apollonian gasket, on the bedroom wall. John throws a birthday party for Molly to make up for the one she missed while in space, and Molly is surprised to see Marcus' brother Tim show up. After talking with Tim throughout the party, Molly discovers, in view of John, that she was the only one who could see him.
