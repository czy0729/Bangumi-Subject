After he mentions very-large-scale integration, Cameron Howe challenges his knowledge of the concept because he didn't refer to it as \"VLSI\". After drinking together later at a bar, Joe and Cameron begin to have sex, but she rebuffs him when Joe says this won't secure her a job. Later, at Cardiff Electric, a system software company, John Bosworth hires Joe, but warns him that they are not competing with IBM and are merely selling software. Gordon Clark accompanies Joe on a sales call, and Joe blames Gordon when the sale falls through. Joe later shows Gordon the issue of Byte magazine, in which Gordon wrote about the untapped potential of computers, and asks him to help reverse-engineer an IBM PC. Gordon is able to isolate the BIOS chip and recreate the assembly language code. Dale Butler, SVP of Sales at IBM, tells Bosworth that Joe left IBM under mysterious circumstances a year ago, adding IBM knows about the reverse-engineering project and the two companies now have a serious problem. Meanwhile, Joe and Gordon convince Cameron to join the project. IBM's legal team arrives at Cardiff's offices.","status":"Air"},{"id":390231,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/390231","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"FUD","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:02","airdate":"2014-06-08","comment":0,"desc":"IBM's lawyers interview each compromised Cardiff Electric employee separately.

Joe tells the remaining engineers the company will have a portable computer, weighing less than 15 pounds with two floppy disk drives and an integrated screen and keyboard, by the end of the year. Joe has lunch with Nathan Cardiff to discuss Bosworth, who soon arrives to be announced as the person to handle all the company's financials. Cardiff also reveals an arranged meeting with LouLu Lutherford (Jean Smart), an heiress and potential investor. However, LouLu offers to buy 80% of the PC project for a paltry $10 million. Joe's frustration with the figure forces Bosworth to accept it, but Joe later seduces LouLu's husband into kissing him and reveals it to her. She pulls out of the deal. At home, Gordon asks his wife Donna about motherboard ideas. She folds a sketch, suggesting stacked boards, thus doubling the power for the same amount of space. However, Brian Braswell kills the idea. Bosworth spots Cameron at the office and tells her she can work as late as needed, but she cannot live there, even though he apparently is temporarily doing exactly that. After getting a sizeable check, she stays at a hotel. Still struggling with the code, she goes to Joe's apartment and walks to the bedroom, while taking off her clothes.","status":"Air"},{"id":390233,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/390233","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Close to the Metal","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:01","airdate":"2014-06-22","comment":0,"desc":"Just as Cameron nears completion of the BIOS code for the new PC, disaster strikes, and she loses all her data, due to what appears (at first) to be a careless mistake. Further complicating the situation, Joe has brought in a reporter from a major business newspaper, and he witnesses the chaos with delight. Bosworth is summoned to a meeting by his boss, Nathan Cardiff, who seems to think he might be losing control of the project (to Joe). Gordon turns to Donna for help with restoring the lost BIOS code. She proposes an ingenious technical solution for recovering the data, which eventually proves successful. Later, a suspicious Donna confronts Joe in his office and accuses him of deliberately sabotaging Cameron's work in an effort to generate some publicity for the project. Joe reaches into a desk drawer and produces the real backup disks, proving her correct. While driving home, Joe is pulled over by the police and savagely beaten for no apparent reason. When Bosworth later arrives at the police station to pick him up, it becomes clear that the beating was a pointed message sent by Bosworth to remind Joe who's really in charge at Cardiff Electric.","status":"Air"},{"id":390234,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/390234","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Adventure","name_cn":"","duration":"00:42:46","airdate":"2014-06-29","comment":0,"desc":"Returning from a trip to Cincinnati, Cameron is surprised to find that Joe has hired a number of new programmers in her absence, including a new \"Software Development Manager.\" (Essentially the job she was promised when hired.) Joe's father arrives in town unexpectedly, and attempts to arrange a meeting with him. Joe at first agrees to meet him, then has second thoughts and fails to show at the appointed time. Realizing that a CRT display will add too much weight to the new computer, Gordon comes up with the idea of using an LCD, as he knows his father-in-law has solid connections with the Japanese electronics firm that manufactures the cutting-edge display. He manages to talk his reluctant father-in-law into arranging a meeting with the Japanese, then blows the deal by getting drunk at the meeting and making rude and insulting comments about his father-in-law to the Japanese lead engineer. Cameron and Joe argue over Joe's decision to hire Steve, the new software manager. When Joe tells her she'll just have to \"Learn to work with people,\" she becomes infuriated, and tells him she'll be picking up her things at his apartment later and moving on. When she arrives at Joe's apartment, she finds his father there, waiting for him. During their subsequent conversation, Cameron realizes how much like his father Joe really is. Gordon shows up at his father-in-law's home still drunk, to tell him what he's done. He apologizes and begs him to speak with the Japanese in an effort to undo the damage he's done. Joe goes to see the Japanese businessmen the next morning for the same reason, unaware that Gordon's father-in-law has already intervened. They appear satisfied, and agree to do business with Cardiff Electric. Later, Joe stops by Gordon's office and finds him working with his engineers on the prototype. He then attempts to humiliate Gordon by relating the events of the previous evening. Gordon cuts him off, telling him that he's accomplished nothing; the situation had already been resolved by Gordon's father-in-law, Gary, before Joe ever took action. This infuriates Joe, and he shows up later at the Cardiff company picnic, taking out his anger and frustration on a Japanese import car with a 5 lb. sledgehammer at $5.00 a blow, as Cameron watches with fascination from the sidelines.","status":"Air"},{"id":390235,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/390235","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Landfall","name_cn":"","duration":"00:42:45","airdate":"2014-07-06","comment":0,"desc":"The prototype computer is finally finished, and boots up successfully to the cheers and applause of the assembled Cardiff employees. Cameron proposes changes to the operating system that would provide a more interactive type of experience for the user, but clashes with Gordon and Joe, who both feel that further changes would only result in unnecessary cost and complexity. After making a rash, drunken promise to Donna that he will find a wildly popular toy for their daughter (a \"Cabbage Patch Kid\" doll), Gordon soon discovers this will be no easy feat. After being cheated out of $80 in a parking lot transaction with a total stranger, he stalks the rain-soaked streets of Dallas on his self-imposed quest, with Hurricane Alicia approaching. He finally reaches the store, but it's closed, and in a rage he smashes the storefront window with a brick, snatching up the pair of dolls in the display. About to flee, he notes a big lightning strike around the corner, and goes to investigate. There he finds a dead woman lying in the street, apparently killed by a downed power line. Shaken and exhausted, he flees the scene. The programmers are becoming fed-up with receiving conflicting orders from Gordon and Cameron, and vent their frustration in an impromptu meeting in Cameron's office. Bosworth calls Cameron into his office for a drink and a talk. He cautions her to be careful, as there are those (at Cardiff) who would like to see her fail, as she \"Represents the future.\" Having been invited to dinner earlier by Gordon, Joe shows up at his home, but the engineer is still out on his doll-hunting quest. Joe must then endure two boisterous children climbing all over him, as well as Donna's aggressive lobbying (on Gordon's behalf) for there to be no further changes to the new computer. While playing with the kids, Joe has a sudden revelation (and second thoughts) about the revised OS. He stops off to see Cameron on his way home, and asks to see her work. When she demonstrates the \"friendly,\" interactive functionality she's designed in, Joe is impressed, and he tells her so. He also finally reveals the truth of how he came by the terrible scars he bears. They appear to reconcile.","status":"Air"},{"id":390236,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/390236","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Giant","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:17","airdate":"2014-07-13","comment":0,"desc":"Cardiff's accountant, Alan, tells Bosworth that the PC division's deficit will take the rest of the company down by the end of next week. Bosworth tells him to keep the news to himself. In the Kill Room, Joe turns up the voltage on a live current, shocking himself, and reaches for Cameron. She touches his hand, allowing the current to flow through her. They have sex, and he then takes a private call. At a QA meeting, the engineers grumble that Cameron's expanded OS has nearly ruined what was great about it. Joe tells Bosworth that he has hired a new designer to work on the casing. Simon Church and his designs are introduced. Joe announces the name of the PC—\"The Contrail\", much to Gordon's dislike. Donna and Hunt present an analysis report to Texas Instruments executives. She suggests they drop the TI-99 from their product list. Hunt later congratulates her for suggesting the idea, adding that she should be bolder more often, which eventually causes her embarrassment when she tries to kiss him. Joe tells Cameron that he and Simon had a brief fling ten years ago. At a strip club, he and Bosworth tries to woo back Kenny, who doubles his original price, while Cameron tracks down Simon to get him back. Simon warns her that Joe will get bored of her, as he did with Simon. Kenny agrees to help, but Bosworth punches him for insulting Joe for not noticing the strippers. They decide to use Simon, whom Joe finds with a drunken Cameron. Simon later tells Joe that he is sick, but agrees to design the case. They kiss, and Cameron misinterprets it, nearly riding off in the cab. Joe catches it and cannot answer her when asked if he will get bored of her. At home, Gordon tells his children the story of the Cardiff Giant, and his obsession causes him to dig a pit in his backyard.","status":"Air"},{"id":390237,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/390237","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"The 214s","name_cn":"","duration":"00:42:43","airdate":"2014-07-20","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":390238,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/390238","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Up Helly Aa","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:16","airdate":"2014-07-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":390239,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/390239","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"1984","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:09","airdate":"2014-08-03","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":17669,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/60/d9/17669_prsn_CZKiH.jpg","name":"李·佩斯","desc":"主演"}],"relations":[{"id":111482,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6b/e9/111482_VVD77.jpg","title":"Halt and Catch Fire (Season 2)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/111482"}]}
