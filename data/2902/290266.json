It was written by Louis C.K. and Pamela Adlon, and directed by Louis C.K.The story is semi-autobiographically based on Adlon's life.The pilot was picked up for a 10-episode first season on August 7, 2015.\r\n\r\nThe title of the show comes from The Kinks song, \"Better Things\".\r\n\r\nIn November 2017, after Louis C.K. confirmed the sexual misconduct allegations against him were true, FX canceled their overall deal with C.K. and his production company, Pig Newton. C.K. will have no involvement in future seasons of the series.That month, Adlon fired 3 Arts manager Dave Becky as her manager. Therefore, Pig Newton and 3 Arts will no longer co-produce the series going forward after they were both removed from the conclusion of the Season 2 finale.For the third season, Adlon hired four new writers for the series: Sara Gubbins, Joe Hortua, Robin Ruzan, and Ira Parker to join her in the writers room, after C.K. was fired by FX","info":"<li><span>集数: </span>12</li><li><span>开始: </span>February 28, 2019</li><li><span>结束: </span>May 16, 2019</li><li><span>类型: </span>剧情/喜剧</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>27min</li><li><span>电视网: </span>FX</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt7531854</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"FX","count":1},{"name":"美剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":902934,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/902934","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Chicago","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"February 28, 2019","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":902935,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/902935","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Holding","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"March 7, 2019","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":902936,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/902936","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Nesting","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"March 14, 2019","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":902937,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/902937","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Monsters in the Moonlight","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"March 21, 2019","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":902938,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/902938","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"No Limit","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"March 28, 2019","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":902939,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/902939","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"What Is Jeopardy?","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"April 4, 2019","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":902940,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/902940","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Toilet","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"April 11, 2019","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":902941,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/902941","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Easter","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"April 18, 2019","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":902942,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/902942","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"The Unknown","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"April 25, 2019","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":902943,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/902943","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Show Me the Magic","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"May 2, 2019","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":902944,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/902944","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Get Lit","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"May 9, 2019","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":902945,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/902945","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Shake the Cocktail","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"May 16, 2019","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":225811,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/44/e6/225811_4x9Zj.jpg","title":"Better Things Season 2","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/225811"}]}
