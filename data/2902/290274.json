The protagonist is a professional thief named Charles Deckard, who is hired by a mysterious organization known as the Black Order to steal an artifact from a New York museum which turns out to be the fabled Pandora's Box. Unaware of the Box's nature, Deckard opens it, unleashing all kinds of mythological creatures rampaging throughout the world, as well as granting him a strange power (the Signet) which could be the key to resolving this crisis. It is up to Deckard and a secret paramilitary force known as the Council of 98 to set things right, while the Black Order seeks to acquire the box and control the creatures to conquer the world.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>传奇：潘多拉魔盒</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/31121\">Gamecock Media Group</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Legendary: The Box</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>传奇</li><li><span>平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unreal Engine 3</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2008年10月24日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Spark Unlimited</li>","collection":{"wish":2},"tags":[{"name":"FPS","count":2},{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"普通游戏","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":31121,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/37/f0/31121_prsn_87A1b.jpg","name":"Gamecock Media Group","desc":"发行"}]}
