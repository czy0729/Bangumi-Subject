Heck, most people don't even think he's been the best Ant-Man! And the last guy invented Ultron and joined the Masters of Evil, so that's saying something. But when the Superior Iron Man calls with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and an old enemy returns (sort of), Scott's going to get a chance to turn it all around and be the hero he's always dreamed of being. That's right, Ant-Man's starting a new life -a bold new adventure - and you know what that means! It means he needs to borrow some money. Sure he's been to prison! Sure he's been through a messy divorce! Sure he's been, um...dead. But this time is different! This time nothing is gonna stop the astonishing Ant-Man!","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>蚁人</li><li><span>出版社: </span>Marvel</li>","relations":[{"id":130121,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/cf/e2/130121_555t5.jpg","title":"Ant-Man","type":"三次元","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/130121"}],"comic":[{"id":210750,"name":"Ant-Man Vol. 1: Second-Chance Man","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/c/44/24/210750_us.jpg"}]}
