Player must defeat various enemies by using bombs or shooting to stun them. Destroyed enemies leave behind items or fruits which can be collected for points. Once all enemies are destroyed, player will proceed to the next level which is generally more difficult. Player can select either Hatsune Miku or Kagamine Rin by default, and by finishing the game will unlock Megurine Luka. The game currently is under development and this preview version has 30 stages. Additional levels and characters (non Vocaloid) will be available in the final release.","info":"<li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1、2</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://ring.u-toyama.ac.jp/pub/freem/2113/Mikun_POP_v101.zip</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":4}}
