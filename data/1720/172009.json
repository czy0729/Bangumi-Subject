The Empires of Britain and France were struggling for control of multiple areas around the world. In North America, that struggle raged for 5 years in actions ranging from isolated skirmishes to full scale invasions.\r\nQuebec would be the primary prize for the armies and its fall would mean the almost guaranteed defeat of New France.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/21895\">HPS Simulations</a></li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Strategy</li><li><span>售价: </span>$49.95</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.hpssims.com/Pages/Products/RifMusk/FIW/FIW.html</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":21895,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9f/0d/21895_prsn_78wII.jpg","name":"HPS Simulations","desc":"开发"}]}
