Accompany the elite US Engineers, its members including Lee, Beauregard, McClellan, Joe Johnston and other soon-to-be-famous officers, as they pry into the Mexican dispositions to find an opening that would lead to victory. Bounce across the arroyos at Buena Vista on the seat of a caisson in a battery commanded by Captain Braxton Bragg, or ride with the US Dragoons alongside Dick Ewell, back in the days when he still had hair--and both legs! Mexican-American War is a tactical level simulation of this conflict using the Early American Wars engine.\r\n\r\nThe war with Mexico presents some fascinating parallels and contrasts with our current history. Mexico in 1846 had a standing army of about 35,000 men, while the Regular Army of the United States mustered only about 7,000 soldiers, with most of them scattered across the western borders of the country, protecting settlers and battling Indians. Employing advanced tactics and superior technology, especially that of the artillery, the US prevailed. Luck, boldness, and skill had something to do with it, too.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/21895\">HPS Simulations</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>MEXICAN WAR</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Strategy</li><li><span>售价: </span>$49.95</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.hpssims.com/Pages/Products/RifMusk/MexAm/mexam.html</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":21895,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9f/0d/21895_prsn_78wII.jpg","name":"HPS Simulations","desc":"开发"}]}
