The plan was simple: General William T. Sherman and his three separate armies with over 110,000 men, would advance south, seek and destroy the Confederate Army of Tennessee, and capture the great Confederate city of Atlanta.\r\n\r\nHowever, a determined General Joseph E. Johnston was ordered to stop this invasion. Johnston's plan was also simple: fortify and defend each mile of southern territory, inflict ever greater losses on the enemy, and force them into a costly mistake.\r\n\r\nCleverly using the difficult terrain of northern Georgia, Johnston's plan nearly worked. But after a hard fought campaign, Sherman took Atlanta, dealing a major blow against the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nNow you can refight the entire 120 mile march to Atlanta, or face the invaders at places like Rocky Face Ridge, Resaca, Kennesaw Mountain, and even Atlanta itself. Your choices will decide the fate of Confederacy. Fight well and bring victory to your chosen side.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/21895\">HPS Simulations</a></li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Strategy</li><li><span>售价: </span>$49.95</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.hpssims.com/Pages/Products/RifMusk/Atlanta/atlanta.html</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":21895,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9f/0d/21895_prsn_78wII.jpg","name":"HPS Simulations","desc":"开发"}]}
