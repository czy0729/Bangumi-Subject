No more would citizen soldiers populate both armies. Rather, they would now be known as professional veterans. For the Confederacy, the brilliance of Robert E. Lee would be needed to keep the southern army alive.\r\nOpposing him, a series of union generals would be tried. Many would fail. In the end, George McClellan would be called upon, a second time, to save the Union. Will he succeed, or will Lee lead southern armies to victory?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHPS's Campaign Antietam faithfully recreates the fateful battles of 1st and 2nd Bull Run, and climaxing with America's bloodiest battle, Antietam. Many other smaller battles are also included that will help lead the way. Take charge and defend your country, whether it be North or South.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/21895\">HPS Simulations</a></li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Strategy</li><li><span>售价: </span>$49.95</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.hpssims.com/Pages/Products/RifMusk/Antietam/antietam.html</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":21895,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9f/0d/21895_prsn_78wII.jpg","name":"HPS Simulations","desc":"开发"}]}
