They work together on missions to protect the shoreside community of Adventure Bay. Each dog has a specific set of skills based on emergency services professions, such as a firefighter, a police officer, and an aviation pilot. They all reside in doghouses that transform into customized vehicles for their missions. They are also equipped with backpacks called \"pup packs\" that contain tools that relate to the pups' jobs.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>汪汪队立大功 第四季</li><li><span>话数: </span>26</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2017年2月6日</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>星期一</li><li><span>动画制作: </span>Guru Studio、<a href=\"/person/14099\">Spin Master</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>狗狗巡逻队 第四季</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>パウ・パトロール シーズン4</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://pawpatrol.com/</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>TVOKids、Nickelodeon</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2018年2月17日</li><li><span>制片人: </span>Patricia Burns</li><li><span>执行制片人: </span>Jennifer Dodge</li><li><span>Copyright: </span>© Spin Master Ltd.
