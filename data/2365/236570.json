To buy a sports car, to build a country house, to find true love, to collect all rare stamps? \r\n\r\nWhat is it? Dream? The purpose of life? Or is it just a mental parasite that has settled in your mind? Any way, your life is no longer a mere existence. Now it is the path. A path that can lead anywhere. A path full of difficulties and questions. \r\n\r\nThe main character is an example of a person who goes to his goal. No matter what it is, no matter how big it is. \r\n\r\nFor example - the main character is looking for milk. Does it sound silly? Let it be. \r\nHow does it feel?\r\n\r\nKatharsis is a first person exploration game, where you will face a bunch of choices and simple puzzles. Sooner or later those choices will lead you to the end of a story. There are a few endings and together they will provide a full game experience.\r\nBut remember - there is no true ending. Every ending is just a piece of a core message that game is trying to say.","info":"<li><span>游戏类型: </span>冒险 独立 模拟</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2017年8月26日</li><li><span>售价: </span>¥ 21</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://store.steampowered.com/app/675730/Katharsis/</li>","collection":{"wish":2}}
