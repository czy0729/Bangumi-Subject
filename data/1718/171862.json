The two flagship products in the Harpoon line up, Advanced Naval Warfare and Commander’s Edition come highly expanded and improved from their previous versions. Advanced Naval Warfare comes with a full suite of editors, upgrades and expansion to the sonar models, boarding actions, encrypted databases, and more! Commander’s Edition sports an all new EMCON AI, an expanded WestPac BattleSet, a greatly improved HCDB database, and more!\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the 20th Anniversary of Harpoon and give fans who enjoy playing the older versions a great archival edition, Harpoon – Ultimate Edition includes more than 20 previous releases of Computer Harpoon including Harpoon 3 v3.63 and Harpoon Classic.  This allows players who have databases or scenarios tied to these older versions to continue to enjoy them for years to come, and it will also allow new players who purchase the Ultimate Edition access to this rich older content.\r\n\r\nWe believe this comprehensive bundle, unlike any that has previously been released for Harpoon on the computer, represents a digital history and \"Collector's Edition\" of Harpoon that every Harpoon gamer will want to have on their shelf for years to come.\r\n\r\nHarpoon- Ultimate Edition is the most powerful and complete modern naval warfare simulation on the market and a must have for any Harpoon fan!\r\n\r\nPlease note that the scenario editor is only compatible with 32 bit windows so unfortunately will not run in 64 bit operating systems. The game however will run fine on either 32 bit or 64 bit systems.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you already own either Harpoon 3 Advanced Naval Warfare or Harpoon Commander's Edition, please go to this link to receive a $25 discount code towards your purchase of Harpoon Ultimate Edition:  http://www.matrixgames.com/discount/harpoonUE.asp\r\n\r\nPlease note: Our previous Harpoon products, Commander's Edition and Advanced Naval Warfare, are not discontinued - they are bundled in with the Ultimate Edition compilation and are still very much alive, regularly updated, and supported by the community.\r\n\r\nCheck out the Commander's Edition Demo here.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>鱼叉</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/21890\">Advanced Gaming Systems</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/21115\">Matrix Games</a></li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RTS</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>3 NOV 2010</li><li><span>售价: </span>€ 57.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.matrixgames.com/products/392/details/Larry.Bond's.Harpoon.-.Ultimate.Edition</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":21890,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/87/21890_prsn_jyC5k.jpg","name":"Advanced Gaming Systems","desc":"开发"},{"id":21115,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ef/d9/21115_prsn_7373M.jpg","name":"Matrix Games","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":165566,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/91/dc/165566_ZZtzX.jpg","title":"Command: Modern Air / Naval Operations WOTY","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/165566"},{"id":198607,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/44/68/198607_8T8ht.jpg","title":"Harpoon 3 Advanced Naval Warfare","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/198607"}]}
