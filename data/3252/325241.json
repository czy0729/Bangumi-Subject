While the show does include characters from the original Bubblegum Crisis, Gall Force and Genesis Survivor Gaiarth, it also has some characters from other anime such as A.D. Police and Riding Bean. It does not matter if you loved or hated any of these series, as long as you have seen at least one of them you will have a great time watching...\r\n\r\nWacky Races! No not really, but close enough. Genom is holding a race; the winner will receive the Genom Trophy! Woohoo! Yay! Enter, Priss on her Motoroid, Linna and Nene, Sylia and Mackie, a Boomer... and characters from the other shows. All will be racing against each other to win this prestigious trophy for some reason. And all of them will do anything to win it...","info":"<li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>别名: </span>Scramble Wars: Tsuppashire!
