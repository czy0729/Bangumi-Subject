Being Top Gear, it tends to involve high powered cars, exotic locations and the odd thing being a little bit on fire. This year they have surpassed themselves, but let's get the boys to tell you about it themselves.\r\n\r\nSeven days, more than 1,000 miles, 20 cars, two boats, a motorbike and one dream...The Perfect Road Trip.\r\n\r\nThe aim: to select the ideal mode of transport for each leg of a pilgrimage from Venice, Italy to Pau in France – home to a legendary street circuit and the origins of Grand Prix racing. On the way we prepare by taking to the track at Monza – the home of Italian Formula One. We try to get noticed on the road course in Monaco in a Bugatti, a Lamborghini and a Model T Ford. After cruising the canals in Venice we take to the tarmac and things look good - thanks to the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta and Mercedes SLS Black. Throw in a Pagani Huayra, Porsche Cayman S and a GT3 as well as the Aston Martin Vanquish centenary edition, Bentley V8 convertible, Rolls Royce Phantom coupe and the face-bending BAC Mono all seems pretty perfect to us.\r\n\r\nThere’s culture too. An all-out effort to get the Birmingham burger-boy to savour the culinary delights of Italy and France – including octopus and an old balcony.\r\n\r\nThen it’s time to turn up the heat even more with a Top Gear race... and the worst forfeit in television history.\r\n\r\nFinally we head to the historic road course in Pau. Surely nothing could spoil our Perfect Road Trip...\r\n\r\nEnjoy...!\r\n\r\nJeremy Clarkson & Richard Hammond\r\n\r\nIncludes a free UltraViolet digital copy.\r\n\r\nSome say that Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip is the perfect present, all we know is that.....\r\n\r\n.......it is!","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>最高档位：完美之旅</li><li><span>集数: </span>1</li><li><span>开始: </span>2013.11.18</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":8,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"TopGear","count":2},{"name":"BBC_HD","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":344247,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/344247","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":117104,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/59/08/117104_zes51.jpg","title":"Top Gear The Perfect Road Trip 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/117104"},{"id":95648,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/97/a8/95648_FaHAi.jpg","title":"Top Gear Season 21","type":"番外篇","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/95648"}]}
