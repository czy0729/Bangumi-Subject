The game was the first 3D title developed by Shade, a development team within Quintet led by graphic designer Kouji Yokota. It is an intended spiritual successor to their previous Super Nintendo games, Soul Blazer and Terranigma (involving Tomoyoshi Miyazaki and Masanori Hikichi).\r\n\r\nThe Granstream Saga is lauded as one of the first fully polygonal RPGs, as opposed to using polygonal characters with pre-rendered backgrounds, polygonal environments with scaling sprites, or other such combinations. The game features anime-style cutscenes by Production I.G. It is also somewhat unusual in that the characters the player meets in the game are faceless.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/10646\">QUINTET</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1018\">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>浮游岛传说</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>The Granstream Saga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>グランストリーム伝記</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ARPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1997年11月6日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":10646,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/c0/04/10646_prsn_Q577J.jpg","name":"QUINTET","desc":"开发"},{"id":1018,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/37/28/1018_prsn_Yvv5n.jpg","name":"索尼互动娱乐","desc":"发行"}]}
