Taito released the game at the height of the platformer genre's success, hoping to finally achieve a solid hit on the system with a proven formula, the same way Hudson Soft had done with their Adventure Island series and Capcom with their Mega Man titles. It was notable for having highly detailed graphics for an 8-bit game, seen in the game's menacing boss characters (which contrasted heavily with the more childlike sprites of the protagonists). In recent years, it has developed a reputation of being one of the most rare and expensive video games in history.\r\n","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>圣铃传说：利克尔</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/7482\">Taito</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>圣铃传说LICKLE</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Little Samson</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年6月26日</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"FC","count":3},{"name":"ACT","count":2},{"name":"Platform","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":7482,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/54/d7/7482_prsn_Ad23D.jpg","name":"太东","desc":"发行"}]}
