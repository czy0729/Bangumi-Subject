Hecky has Jasmine take photographs of the incident, the ones he would later use for blackmail. Three weeks later, Captain Parker and his mob squad are investigating the murders committed by Sid at the restaurant. The murder victims are revealed to be informants who knew that Siegel had killed Greenberg. The next day, the squad gathers up dozens of mob figures hoping to gather some information on the recent crimes. One of the mobsters let it slip that Hecky's blackmail was pictures, worrying Joe about Jasmine's safety. Suddenly, Ned Stax's arrives with Sid, who has come to willingly be interrogated. Sid taunts Joe during the interrogation and is then sent to a police line up. An eye witness to the murders identifies the wrong man, forcing them to let Sid go. Meanwhile, Jasmine meets a man named Leslie Shermer, who claims to have been in on Hecky's blackmail and threatens Jasmine to give him the money Hecky owes him for the deal. Joe visits Jasmine later that night to tell her that there is no longer a surveillance team on her and that he knows about the locker at the Union Station, taking the key off her for safe keeping. Suddenly, Mickey Cohen and Sid visit Jasmine to question her about anything she might know about who helped Hecky take the photographs. Joe hides outside on a fire escape, where he over hears Mickey and Sid talk about how Carl, the busboy from the previous night, is about to get murdered by their men. Joe quickly goes looking for Carl, who he finds being chased by Cohen's men on a carousel. Joe guns down the the men, saving Carl's life. Carl then confesses he knows who committed the restaurant murders, Sid Rothman.","status":"Air"},{"id":346334,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/346334","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"His Banana Majesty","name_cn":"","duration":"00:42:10","airdate":"2013-12-11","comment":0,"desc":"Bugsy Siegel arrives back in Los Angeles after a trip to Las Vegas. He is immediately arrested by Captain Parker for the murder of Abe Greenberg. Although, this back fires on Parker as he does not have sufficient evident against Siegel and only has twenty-six hours to find any. Word spreads about Siegel's arrest and other mobsters who work for Jack Dragna try to take over Siegel's business while he is in prison. Jasmine is sent a threatening message by Leslie, who is still demanding money from the blackmail. She goes to Ned for help, who gives her enough money to pay Leslie off. The two begin to discuss Joe and how he has changed since the war. Meanwhile, mob squad members Eddy Sanderson, Pat Dollan and Tug Purcell plant a bug in Cohen's office. Jasmine tries to give Leslie the money, but he has now found out that the deal was for a larger sum of money than he had thought and now wants the whole fifty grand. Not having the money, Jasmine offers Leslie the pictures she has hidden at the Union Station, which Leslie gives her twenty-four hours to get. Ned is called upon by a mobster named \"Bunny\", the owner of \"Bunny's Jungle\", who fears that a recent death during the mob take overs while Siegel was in prison could start a potential war. Mickey Cohen retaliates against the recent mob attacks by ransacking one of the mobsters warehouses which is a banana distributor. Later that night, Joe arrives home where he is met by Sid Rothman, who knocks him unconscious.","status":"Air"},{"id":346335,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/346335","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Oxpecker","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-12-18","comment":0,"desc":"In 1944, Joe wakes up from a nightmare and begins to strangle Jasmine, thinking he is still at war, but snaps out of it and breaks down crying over hurting his wife.

Joe refuses to tell him, but Rothman finds out about Joe and Jasmine's past marriage after looking through a photo album and threatens her safety.
