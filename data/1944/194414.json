Despite these accolades, Oshii is known as a contrarian within anime, a self-proclaimed 'stray dog', avoiding the limelight in favour of his own personal cinematic vision. He cannot be pigeon-holed, working in both live-action film and animation, directing everything from absurdist comedy to thrillers to meditations on the nature of reality. Stray Dog of Anime is the first book to take an in-depth look at Oshii's major films, form his early days working on Urusei Yatsura to Avalon , his most recent feature. Ruh details Oshii's evolution as a director, paying special attention to his personal style and symbolism, resulting in a unique guide that will appeal to anime fans and cinestes of all kinds.","info":"<li><span>出版社: </span>Palgrave Macmillan</li><li><span>价格: </span>$20.00</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2004-06-12</li><li><span>页数: </span>230</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>1403963347</li><li><span>作者: </span>B.
