Thomas Lamarre contends that the history, techniques, and complex visual language of animation, particularly Japanese animation, demands serious and sustained engagement, and in The Anime Machine he lays the foundation for a new critical theory for reading Japanese animation, showing how anime fundamentally differs from other visual media.","info":"<li><span>出版社: </span>Univ Of Minnesota Press</li><li><span>价格: </span>$24.95</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2009-10-30</li><li><span>页数: </span>408</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>0816651558</li><li><span>作者: </span>Thomas Lamarre</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"doing":1}}
