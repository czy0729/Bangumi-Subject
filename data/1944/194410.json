There are three premises: (1) the abstract concepts promoted by Japanese aesthetics find concrete expression at the most disparate levels of everyday life; (2) the abstract and the concrete coalesce in the visual domain, attesting to the visual nature of Japanese culture at large; and (3) anime can help us appreciate many aspects of Japan's aesthetic legacy, in terms of both its theoretical propositions and its visual, even tangible, aspects.","info":"<li><span>出版社: </span>McFarland</li><li><span>价格: </span>$35.00</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2013-01-03</li><li><span>页数: </span>207</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>0786471514</li><li><span>作者: </span>Dani Cavallaro</li>","collection":{"on_hold":1}}
