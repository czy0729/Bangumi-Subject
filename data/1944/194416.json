In her history of the manga industry, Sharon Kinsella documents the structure and history of manga, probes into its related subculture and the anti-nerd \"otaku\" panic, and examines the difficult and fascinating relationship between the artists and editors who create manga. In the process, she argues that Japanese comics have shifted from being a lower-class medium for marginal citizens to becoming a novel form of official communication, recently embraced by big business and national institutions. This ascent of manga through various layers of post-war society reflects the wider transformation of politics and social organization in Japan during the last years of the 20th century.","info":"<li><span>出版社: </span>Routledge</li><li><span>价格: </span>$38.95</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2000-06-29</li><li><span>页数: </span>244</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>0700710043</li><li><span>作者: </span>Sharon Kinsella</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"doing":1}}
