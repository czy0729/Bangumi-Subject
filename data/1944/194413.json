From the battling robots that define the mecha genre through to Studio Ghibli's dominant genre-brand of plucky shojo (young girl) characters, this book charts the rise of anime as a globally significant category of animation. It further thinks through the differences between anime's local and global genres: from the less-considered niches like nichijo-kei (everyday style anime) through to the global popularity of science fiction anime, this book tackles the tensions between the markets and audiences for anime texts.","info":"<li><span>出版社: </span>Bloomsbury Academic</li><li><span>价格: </span>$29.95</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2015-12-03</li><li><span>页数: </span>200</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>1847884792</li><li><span>作者: </span>Rayna Denison</li>","collection":{"on_hold":1}}
