{"id":194418,"type":1,"name":"Traditional Monster Imagery in Manga, Anime and Japanese Cinema","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0a/0b/194418_us.jpg","summary":"\"Traditional Monster Imagery in Manga, Anime and Japanese Cinema\" builds on the earlier volume \"Anime and its Roots in Early Japanese Monster Art,\" that aimed to position contemporary Japanese animation within a wider art historical context by tracing the development of monster representations in Edo- and Meiji-period art works and post-war visual media. While the previous volume concentrated on modern media representations, this work focuses on how Western art historical concepts and methodology might be adapted when considering non-Western works, introducing traditional monster art in more detail, while also maintaining its links to post-war animation, sequential art and Japanese cinema. The book aims at a general readership interested in Japanese art and media as well as graduate students who might be searching for a research model within the fields of Animation Studies, Media Studies or Visual Communication Design.","info":"<li><span>出版社: </span>Global Oriental</li><li><span>价格: </span>$121.00</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2010-10-29</li><li><span>页数: </span>244</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>1906876525</li><li><span>作者: </span>Zilia Papp</li>","collection":{"on_hold":1}}
