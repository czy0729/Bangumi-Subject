Satoshi Kon crashed onto the world scene in 1997 with his smart slasher-thriller Perfect Blue. His subsequent films range from the silver-screen romance of Millennium Actress (2001) to the socially conscious comedy Tokyo Godfathers (2003) and the surreally satirical TV series Paranoia Agent (2004). This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the work and vision of Satoshi Kon, with background and analysis of the key reality-warping films by anime’s premier illusionist. This timely new collection follows the 2007 US release of Kon’s latest film, Paprika, which was met with an enthusiastic welcome from his fans. For many, Paprika was a first introduction to Kon’s work; other fans have been following his career avidly from its early days. Satoshi Kon: The Illusionist will satisfy newcomers and long-term fans alike.","info":"<li><span>出版社: </span>Stone Bridge Press</li><li><span>价格: </span>$18.95</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2009-12-01</li><li><span>页数: </span>128</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>1933330740</li><li><span>作者: </span>Andrew Osmond</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":1}}
