It stars a submissive named Jill, who has a boot fetish and is forced to climb up a tower after her Queen kicks her down it as punishment. Jill does this by jumping and slowly descending over obstacles. Jill can be defeated in one hit by these obstacles, but will return to the last check point. The game serves as an homage to the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack. It had follow-ups, such as Mighty Jill Off - Jill Off Harder Edition and Jill Off With One Hand. Jill made a cameo appearance in the 2010 video game Super Meat Boy as a playable character.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>Single-player</li><li><span>售价: </span>Free download</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://mightyjilloff.dessgeega.com/</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"relations":[{"id":74554,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/44/e3/74554_ve7eV.jpg","title":"マイティボンジャック","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/74554"}]}
