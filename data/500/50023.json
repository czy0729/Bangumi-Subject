It was developed by the Creative Assembly. Its main addition was to add a new campaign set in 1230, hypothesizing a successful Mongol landing in Japan. This campaign had only 2 factions, the Hojo (possessing all of Japan) and the new faction, the Mongols. The gameplay of this campaign was notable in that the Mongols were unable to recruit troops in any conquered provinces, but instead had to rely on reinforcements periodically appearing in coastal provinces to replenish their troops. In addition to this campaign, the expansion also added \"eras\" to the original campaign, as well as several new units and a campaign of Historical Battles.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>幕府将军:全面战争 蒙古入侵</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>回合制策略/即时战略</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1-8人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2001年8月8日</li><li><span>开发: </span>The Creative Assembly</li><li><span>游戏发行: </span>EA</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"relations":[{"id":7749,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d0/42/7749_Y2YLP.jpg","title":"Shogun:Total war　","type":"主线故事","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/7749"}]}
