He can, however, absorb the traits of anything he eats, is virtually indestructible, and can grow to unlimited size. If he wasn't a danger to all life in the universe, he'd make the perfect pet. In this action/adventure game, he's the best friend of our hero Frank, and only by working together can Maw eat their way to freedom. The Maw was honored with the Audience Choice Award in the 2008 PAX-10 showcase of independent games, and is a finalist at this year's Independent Games Festival for Technical Excellence.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>宠物外星人</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Casual</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"Casual","count":1}]}
