He finds himself drafted into the Army, where he's assigned to be the bugler of an African-American company. But everyone hates the bugler, because he blows reveille at the ungodly hour of 5 AM sharp. Sure enough, on his first day, Harry gets pelted with everything imaginable. He lands against a wall, where his trumpet falls on him. He plays a swinging wakeup that segues into the title tune, and nobody minds waking up to this. Everyone swings through the whole day, even when three soldiers march into a lake and two soldiers, followed by a grinning alligator, march out.","info":"<li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1941年9月1日</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧 / 动画 / 短片 / 音乐</li><li><span>导演: </span>Walter Lantz</li><li><span>IMDb: </span>tt0033424</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":5},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":2}],"eps":[{"id":1001458,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1001458","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
