He crawls into the machine, but the mechanism flings him out the coin return. The mouse lands in a glass of Zowie beverage, which he happily drinks. Bottles tip over, releasing the spirits (both alcoholic and ghostly) within. The ghosts form a band, at first just playing rhythm (with peanuts as maracas). Turtles in the cafe's fountain start dancing. A lobster on a plate does a Carmen Miranda impression. The figures on a lamp dance around the shade. A cactus dances with the mouse. The mouse hits the floor, knocking several mouse ghosts loose; they form a conga line, leading to the mouse's bed, where he falls back to sleep.","info":"<li><span>上映年度: </span>1942</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>喜剧 / 动画 / 短片 / 歌舞 / 家庭</li><li><span>导演: </span>Alex Lovy</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Ben Hardaway / Chuck Couch</li><li><span>IMDb: </span>tt0034925</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
