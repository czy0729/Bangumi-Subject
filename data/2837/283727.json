Using a unique perspective rotation mechanic, players can bring enemies and items into view, putting the odds in their favor in an otherwise impossible situation.\r\n\r\nIn Revolver 360 RE:ACTOR, you don't only have your bullets to save you. You're also armed with a powerful laser that pierces through weaker enemies, and a screen-clearing EMP. It's the exact kind of weaponry you're going to need if you hope to survive this harsh and hostile environment.\r\n\r\nUse your weapons in concert with each other to toy with your enemies and reap higher score rewards. Killing your foes quickly is not always the best course of action.\r\n\r\nRevolver 360 RE:ACTOR comes with a full suite of challenging mini-missions that will not only teach you advanced techniques to improve your scoring and survivability, but also challenge the most hardcore of shmup players with insane scenarios. Not quite sure how to complete a challenge? Challenge mode also has a dynamic hint system to help you learn how to properly surmount a challenge.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>次元转换射击</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>清版射击</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2014年10月25日</li><li><span>售价: </span>￥36</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://store.steampowered.com/app/313400/</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}]}
