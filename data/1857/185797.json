You play as Robert Hughes, a plague-stricken scientist on a journey to discover a cure. Your adventure begins on the shores of a remote and mysterious island. Long ago, the island was inhabited by a group of indigenous people, whose extant monuments still decorate the island landscape. The island is now home to a scientific research outpost and it is your hope to reunite with your colleagues working there. Unfortunately, you'll soon discover that something has gone terribly wrong.\r\n\r\nDuring your adventure, you will encounter a mysterious and deadly creature. This creature can stalk you for miles, lurking behind grasses and vegetative cover. By treading carefully and with stealth, you may be able to elude the creature. If you are careless, however, you will be forced to confront the creature head-on.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>密斯玛塔</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>动作;冒险;独立</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2012年11月29日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$2.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://ionfx.com/product_pc_Miasmata.php</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":2,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"STEAM","count":2},{"name":"独立游戏","count":1}]}
