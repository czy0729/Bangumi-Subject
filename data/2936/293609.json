The game levels take place in a number of different locations, with each location having a unique topography, including two or more pizza kitchens. Each of these kitchens is responsible for producing and delivering pizzas with a specific topping. During gameplay, customers will appear with an icon representing a specific pizza topping they are calling to order. This icon must be clicked, and the player must then click the correct pizza kitchen in order to dispatch the needed pizza to the customer. If players take too long, or try to deliver the wrong pizza, the customer hangs up the phone, causing a decrease in overall customer satisfaction. If customer satisfaction dips low enough, the game ends.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/3869\">PopCap Games</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Pizza Frenzy Deluxe</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2005年2月2日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":3869,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/c1/33/3869_prsn_Qr177.jpg","name":"宝开游戏","desc":"发行"}]}
