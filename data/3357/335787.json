It was released February 25, 2008 in North America. It was produced by the now-defunct Kaos Studios. Frontlines: Fuel of War was also originally in development for the PlayStation 3, although THQ announced it had canceled work on this version on January 24, 2008, seemingly as a result of problems with developing for the PlayStation 3, issues that had been referenced in interviews prior to the PlayStation 3 version's cancellation.\r\n\r\nFrontlines includes a multiplayer mode as well as a single-player campaign that uses the Frontlines system found in the multiplayer component. Single-player mode limits the players to the fictional Western Coalition, while online modes let players play as either the Western Coalition (WC) or Red Star Alliance (RSA). It is not bot compatible. A multiplayer demo of the game was released for the Xbox 360 on February 11, 2008. A demo was also released for the PC. Towards the end of 2012, the PC online multiplayer mode of the game was no longer available, although the LAN mode still operates.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>前线：战火之源</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/16404\">THQ</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unreal Engine 3</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2008年2月25日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Kaos Studios</li>","staff":[{"id":16404,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b5/f5/16404_prsn_IwyQE.jpg","name":"THQ公司","desc":"发行"}]}
