The game allows play from an evil perspective, with the player leading armies of Undead and Shadowbeasts. It introduces an improved AI, new units and three new campaigns, as well as some new multiplayer maps and modes. However, it was criticized for not bringing enough new features to justify its cost.\r\n\r\nThe main campaign of Ahriman's Gift serves as the prequel to the original game with the perspective from the evil Ceyah Kohan led by their champion Mistress Vashti, formerly Roxanna Javidan wife of Darius Javidan, the main protagonist of the original game. The Quest for Darius follows the story of Ilyana Aswan and her armies as she races against time and evil to recover the amulet of Darius Javidan, while the Slaanri campaign features the newly reawakened Slaanri champion, Slyy's Stok as he struggles to remember his past and unite the tribes of his people against an unknown enemy.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>可汗：恶灵的礼物</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/41758\">TimeGate Studios</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/34218\">Strategy First</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Kohan: Battles of Ahriman</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>可汗之恶灵所赐</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RTS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2001年11月5日</li>","staff":[{"id":41758,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b2/2d/41758_prsn_YM0Se.jpg","name":"TimeGate Studios","desc":"开发"},{"id":34218,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/82/88/34218_prsn_RbU1b.jpg","name":"策略第一","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":335777,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f0/0d/335777_tK4v2.jpg","title":"Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns","type":"主线故事","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/335777"}]}
