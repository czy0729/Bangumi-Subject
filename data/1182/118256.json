When preparing the day's President's Daily Briefing (PDB), the team is made aware of the abduction of an American doctor in Kenya and the possibility that he will be killed in a few hours. But the JSOC team tracking Omar Abdul Fatah feels they've a good possibility of killing him. But in the absence of confirmation and that they cannot get the other senior leadership of Fatah's group, Charlie refuses to add it in the PDB. The CIA Director feels that she has disobeyed orders and therefore suspends her. However, she meets with the President and convinces her that the life of the hostage is more important, leading the President to order the JSOC team to rescue the doctor instead.","status":"Air"},{"id":448250,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/448250","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Secrets & Lies","name_cn":"","duration":"00:41:02","airdate":"2014-11-24","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":448251,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/448251","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Half the Sky","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-12-01","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":448252,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/448252","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Bang, Bang","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-12-08","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":448253,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/448253","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-12-15","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":448254,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/448254","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-12-22","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":448255,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/448255","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2015-01-05","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":448256,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/448256","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2015-01-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":448257,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/448257","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2015-01-19","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":448258,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/448258","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2015-01-26","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
