At first content to slowly build their strength within a small region, the Necromancers will soon reveal their awesome power as they move to subjugate the entire land for their evil purposes. Wielding dark magic, they have perfected the art of raising the dead and now command these terrible minions to obey their slightest whim. Amassing an army is a trivial task for those that can summon the black legions of departed souls. You must embark upon a journey to improve strength and skill, enlist powerful allies, and recover a lost talisman of ancient magic to survive the coming onslaught. Ultimately you must seek out the lair of the Necromancers and destroy them and their undead puppets before they can carry out their terrifying plans. Are you ready?","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>巫师之怒2</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/31192\">Nival Inc</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/31192\">Nival Inc</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>愤怒的魔法师2</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1999年7月31日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://en.nival.com/games/pc-games/rage-of-mages-2</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":31192,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/8d/75/31192_prsn_W852n.jpg","name":"Nival Inc","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":230064,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9a/a8/230064_RsDs3.jpg","title":"Rage of Mages","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/230064"}]}
