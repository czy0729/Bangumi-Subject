It features tactical turn-based combat, a vast underground world to explore, extensive character customization possibilities and a detailed item crafting system. Many different playstyles are allowed by the character customization options. The player controls a single character, whose development and interactions with the game world are the focus of the gameplay.\r\nThe game's ruleset is mainly inspired by the SPECIAL system from the Fallout series. It is a classless system with multiple levels of customization. Base ability scores determine a character's core potential, skills represent a character's linear progression in specific skills and feats can grant new abilities, provide passive bonuses or alter a character's existing abilities. The turn-based combat system is similar to Fallout's with more options added on top of it, such as the use of special abilities, psionics and more combat utilities. The system is intended to provide many combat options and unique playstyles.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>地铁余生</li><li><span>别名: </span>轨道之下</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Under Rail</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC (Windows)</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG/ 回合制/科幻</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2015-12-18</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://underrail.com</li><li><span>开发: </span>Stygian Software</li><li><span>发行: </span>Stygian Software</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Dejan Radisic</li>","collection":{"wish":4},"tags":[{"name":"CRPG","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":297761,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c2/cd/297761_u733h.jpg","title":"Underrail: Expedition","type":"资料片、外传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/297761"}]}
