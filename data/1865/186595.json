He stated that it was debatable whether an owner of The Orange Box should purchase this, as its added levels do not add to the plot. However, he praised the quality of the new maps included in the game. The game ranked 7th in a later list of top Xbox Box Live titles compiled by IGN's staff in September 2010.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>传送门：幸存</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/16323\">Valve</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/16859\">Xbox Game Studios</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Source</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2008年10月22日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$14.99</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"XBOX360","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":16323,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/07/5e/16323_prsn_99mDm.jpg","name":"威尔乌","desc":"开发"},{"id":16859,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/cd/16859_prsn_48aP4.jpg","name":"Xbox游戏工作室","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":9658,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/2d/6c/17059_8y48I.jpg","title":"Half-Life 2","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/9658"},{"id":192080,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/18/25/192080_7XClm.jpg","title":"Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun Testing Initiative","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/192080"},{"id":283456,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6c/23/283456_P4z0N.jpg","title":"The Lab","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/283456"},{"id":295322,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c6/e6/295322_3m3NS.jpg","title":"Aperture Hand Lab","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/295322"},{"id":10038,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0f/6b/10038_A84A8.jpg","title":"Portal","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/10038"}]}
