It is set in the continuity of the animated series Batman Beyond, in which Bruce Wayne has retired from crime fighting, giving the mantle of Batman to high school student Terry McGinnis, and serves as a sequel to both Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures. As in the TV series, Will Friedle and Kevin Conroy star as Terry McGinnis and Bruce Wayne, respectively. Mark Hamill, who played the Joker opposite Conroy in Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, reprises his role.\r\n\r\nBefore its release, the movie was heavily edited to remove scenes of extreme violence, and some dialogue was altered, thus creating the \"Not-Rated\" version of the movie. The original version was subsequently released on DVD following an online petition to have the original version released. It received a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for violence, the first animated Batman film and from Warner Bros. Family Entertainment to do so.\r\n\r\nMephisto Odyssey and Static-X contributed the song \"Crash (The Humble Brothers Remix)\" on the film's soundtrack, along with a music video directed by Len Wiseman featured on the DVD.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>未来蝙蝠侠：小丑归来</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>原作: </span><a href=\"/person/24742\">DC Comics</a></li><li><span>脚本: </span><a href=\"/person/13960\">Bruce Timm</a></li><li><span>制片人: </span><a href=\"/person/13960\">Bruce Timm</a></li><li><span>动画制作: </span><a href=\"/person/13957\">Warner Bros.
