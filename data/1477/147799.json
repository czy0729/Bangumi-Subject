Gil Grissom, meanwhile, working to preserve sharks in international waters, is arrested for trespassing at the Port of San Diego, and D.B. Russell offers Sara Sidle the chance to supervise the local investigation into the bombing. Sidle, who is vying for the position of Director of the Las Vegas Crime Lab, is initially irked when Sheriff Conrad Ecklie inquires as to Grissom's location when Lady Heather Kessler is linked to the crime. Ecklie ensures Grissom is released from custody, and he and Willows, alongside Eclipse security officer Jim Brass, assist in locating the suspect.\r\n\r\nAs the team work to restore safety to the streets of Las Vegas, D.B. decides it's time for him to \"head East\" and pursue new challenges, while he places a plaque, dedicated to the memory of Julie Finlay, alongside his personal possessions. Catherine expresses an interest in leaving the FBI and working alongside her daughter Lindsey in the Las Vegas Crime Lab, noting that, should Sara reject the promotion she is going to be offered, Catherine will accept it in lieu of her former colleague. The series ends with the newly-promoted Sara, upon hearing a recording of Grissom confessing his love for her, sailing from the Port of San Diego with Grissom.\r\n\r\nThere are reports stating that Sara would quit and Catherine would take over her position as Lab Director, but those scenes were cut from the aired episode.\r\nProduction[edit]\r\nThe finale was shot over seventeen days.[4] Filming for the principal cast began on July 29, 2015,[5] and production wrapped on August 21, 2015.[6] It was filmed as two episodes under the titles \"Immortality Part I\" and \"Immortality Part II\", respectively. The production codes for the episodes are 1601 and 1602.[5]\r\n\r\nCasting[edit]\r\nDuring the CBS 2015 Upfront, Les Moonves and Nina Tassler announced that former lead actors Marg Helgenberger and William Petersen would be reprising their roles as Catherine Willows and Gil Grissom, respectively.[2] Helgenberger reported that, while Petersen was returning, the character of Grissom would take a back seat to FBI Special Agent Willows, stating that she will be \"running the case, not Billy.\"[7] Ted Danson, who has starred in the series since the beginning of the twelfth season, will also reprise his role.[2]\r\n\r\nOn July 24, 2015, it was confirmed that both George Eads, who played Nick Stokes for fifteen seasons, and Elisabeth Shue, who played the lead role of Julie Finlay for four seasons, had declined to return. Elisabeth Harnois, Jorja Fox, Eric Szmanda, Robert David Hall, Wallace Langham, David Berman, and Jon Wellner, will all reprise their roles,[8] as will former lead Paul Guilfoyle, and guest star Melinda Clarke, who appeared as Lady Heather Kessler, a long time friend of Grissom.[8]\r\n\r\nKatie Stevens was cast as Lindsey Willows, Catherine's daughter, a CSI Level 1.[9] Recurring guest star Marc Vann will also return as Sheriff Conrad Ecklie,[10] as will Larry Mitchell as Officer Mitchell.[11]\r\n\r\nProduction credits[edit]\r\nThe episodes were directed by Louis Milito, and written by series creator Anthony E.
