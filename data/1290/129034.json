Guarnido's sumptuously painted pages and rich cinematic style bring the world of 1950s America to vibrant life, with Canales weaving in fascinating tales of conspiracy, racial tension, and the 'red scare' Communist witch hunts of the time. Guarnido reinvents anthropomorphism in these pages, and industry colleagues no less than Will Eisner, Jim Steranko, and Tim Sale are fans! Whether John Blacksad is falling for dangerous women or getting beaten to within an inch of his life, his stories are, simply put, unforgettable.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>墨萨德</li><li><span>出版社: </span><a href=\"/person/35090\">Dark Horse Comics</a></li><li><span>ISBN: </span>9781595823939</li><li><span>作者: </span>Juan Diaz Canales / Juanjo Guarnido</li><li><span>开始: </span>2000年11月1日</li>","collection":{"wish":16,"collect":13,"doing":4,"on_hold":2},"tags":[{"name":"欧美漫画","count":4},{"name":"漫画","count":3},{"name":"硬派","count":2},{"name":"欧洲漫画","count":1},{"name":"黑猫警长","count":1},{"name":"欧美","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":35090,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9e/b0/35090_prsn_NiUBz.jpg","name":"黑马漫画","desc":"出版社"}],"relations":[{"id":284945,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/47/a3/284945_A70K3.jpg","title":"Blacksad: Under the Skin","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/284945"}]}
