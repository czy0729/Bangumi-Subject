Now, a young boy named Trevor must try to keep his younger brother Will from falling victim to the worst fears of a troubled town that can't begin to understand the tragic secret that binds its families together. Some folks would call Trevor's brother a monster. But to Trevor, Will is just another kid trapped in a dark reality he can't comprehend. When the situation moves from bad to worse, and their father threatens to do away with Will, Trevor learns that they're not alone - that \"freak\" children were born to other families in Gristlewood Valley. Against all odds, and with nothing but love for his brother in his heart, Trevor is going to do whatever he can to get the freak children out of harm's way, if it's not already too late.\r\n","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>远山的弃儿</li><li><span>出版社: </span>Dark Horse</li><li><span>作者: </span>Steve Niles / Greg Ruth</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2005-07-06</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>9781593070298</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"漫画","count":2},{"name":"欧美漫画","count":1},{"name":"欧美","count":1}]}
