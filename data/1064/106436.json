Spate is a dark, brooding, and beautifully crafted emotional journey that is seen through the eyes of a struggling addict. Created by former Disney & Jim Henson artist Eric Provan, this artistic game is a story about one man's struggle and descent into madness. Fueled by absinthe hallucinations and haunting memories, Spate delivers a deliciously eerie adventure as the main character deals with the tragic loss and grim reality of the death of his daughter.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>雨一直下</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"AVG","count":1}]}
