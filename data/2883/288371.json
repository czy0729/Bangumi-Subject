Gold and silver on coated darkness shimmer in the hands of players while they move their iPad or iPhone. Based on a real ancient story, the game tells the tale of a curious empress, a lost love and a blossoming friendship.\r\n\r\nIn over 60 handmade puzzles, players connect golden moons to separate the sea from the sky. Each level transforms their device into a beautiful Japanese lacquer box, which players need to think outside of! To engage with SHI•RO's story, players have to find the golden elements in the game's handdrawn illustrations. Taiko drums lead their way from one star constellation to the next, puzzle by puzzle, word by word, further in time.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>古事记</li><li><span>开发: </span>Topicbird</li><li><span>发行: </span>The Brothers Grimm</li><li><span>平台: </span>IOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2018-07-17 (IOS)</li><li><span>售价: </span>￥18</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>play-shiro.com</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"Mobile","count":1},{"name":"PUZ","count":1}]}
