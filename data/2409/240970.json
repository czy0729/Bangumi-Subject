Face the realities of a collapsing society as you make difficult choices in seemingly lose-lose situations. The plague isn’t just a disease. You can’t save everyone.\r\nGet to know it, winning the affection of the locals and gaining allies, or try to carve your own path alone. Explore the Town, its inhabitants, and their traditions; fight both the plague itself and its victims; try to make a difference before the time runs out.\r\n\r\nFigure out who killed your father while fighting a deadly plague. It’s up to you to assume his mantle of the town’s Chief Medic.\r\nFind your alleged twin sister. Was she the one who had brought the plague to this town?\r\nThe local kids are hiding something. Try playing by their rules.\r\n\r\nYou only have 12 days.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>瘟疫2</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32233\">Ice-Pick Lodge</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/30772\">tinyBuild</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019年5月23日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>pathologic-game.com/</li>","collection":{"wish":4,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"XboxOne","count":1},{"name":"PS4","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"RPG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":32233,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/97/e0/32233_prsn_58i5Q.jpg","name":"Ice-Pick Lodge","desc":"开发"},{"id":30772,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ac/9c/30772_prsn_t7eTE.jpg","name":"tinyBuild","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":151893,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/45/2a/151893_lUUys.jpg","title":"Pathologic","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/151893"}]}
