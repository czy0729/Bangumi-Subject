The animated stylised figures move beautifully in time with the music, leaping and stamping to the musical score. The bursts of abstraction within the film are often just a few gliding brush strokes cleverly depicting the human form in movement. With the use of airbrush and watercolour, one can see black shapes move against the orange, ochre and stripes of primary colour and a host of multiplying dance forms. \r\n　　Erica Russell researched extensively for her film in dance, music, African masks, sculpture and body painting.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>舞动</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1988</li><li><span>片长: </span>5min</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>无对白</li><li><span>导演: </span>Erica Russell</li><li><span>主演: </span>Gasper Lawal / Alfred Bannerman</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/559747/</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":2}}
