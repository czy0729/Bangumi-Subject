For too long, we have held the mistaken belief that the world was created entirely for our benefit. As countless plant and animal species become extinct, our generous planet has little left to offer: clean water and lush forests are becoming increasingly rare. The film ends, however, on a positive note: Frédéric Back cherishes the hope that future generations will rediscover the joy of sharing and the importance of living in harmony with nature.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>一无所有</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>别名: </span>All Nothing</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1978</li><li><span>片长: </span>11分钟</li><li><span>语言: </span>无对白</li><li><span>IMDb链接: </span>tt0080351</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>加拿大</li><li><span>类型: </span>动画 / 短片</li><li><span>导演: </span>Frédéric Back</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Frédéric Back</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":3,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":913186,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/913186","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
