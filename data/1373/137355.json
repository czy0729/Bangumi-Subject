However, despite the relatively low budget, the film turns out to be a very effective way to teach kids about the dangers of unprotected sex. \r\n　　The film begins with three teenage girl dolls sitting on a bench. Without using actual words but sort of a Sims-type speech (\"Bla, bla, bla\"), the first girl describes her perfect man. Then, suddenly, he appears---as does a bed. They push it off camera and sound effects of them having sex can be heard. Then, she returns to her friends--pregnant and alone. The same thing happens with the same except that this time she returns with the news that she has HIV! So, when the third girl's boyfriend appears along with the bed, she isn't about to risk pregnancy or disease and insists on a condom. \r\n　　This isn't exactly the best viewing for all ages, but to me seems great for teens. In a funny way, it uses strange metaphors to teach an important lesson. Excellent writing more than make up for cheesy stop-motion.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>性感的十六岁</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2006</li><li><span>片长: </span>5min</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>阿根廷</li><li><span>语言: </span>西班牙语</li><li><span>导演: </span>Juan Pablo Zaramella</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Juan Pablo Zaramella</li><li><span>主演: </span>Silvina Cornillón / Juan Pablo Zaramella</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":9,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"2006","count":1},{"name":"短片","count":1}]}
