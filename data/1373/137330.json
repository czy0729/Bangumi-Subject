Their perfect times together are interrupted by a bee and some sneezes. An enforced separation inspired by caring parents' pales into insignificance when the cow finds herself on another planet. Her quest to get home to see her friend is ludicrously employed and as it turns out - suicidal. We discover that friendship can be fickle, actions have consequences and that hot milk and honey can relieve the common cold.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>哞（月）</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2003</li><li><span>片长: </span>3min</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>导演: </span>Leigh Hodgkinson</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Leigh Hodgkinson</li><li><span>主演: </span>Tom Hillenbrand / Robert Llewellyn / Matt Lucas</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":5,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"2003","count":2},{"name":"欧美","count":1},{"name":"短片","count":1}]}
