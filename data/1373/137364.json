The story itself of a very, very hungry cat that eats anything and everything is only okay, but it doesn't matter too much since the film is more like a piece of art than a traditional film. As for the clay, the story is told using two-dimensional ableaux that morph and change before your eyes. It's all rather hypnotic and cool and is well worth seeing.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>名为蒙斯的猫</li><li><span>别名: </span>Mons the Cat / 贪心不足猫吞日</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1995</li><li><span>片长: </span>4min</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>挪威</li><li><span>语言: </span>挪威语</li><li><span>导演: </span>Pjotr Sapegin</li>","collection":{"collect":3,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":1},{"name":"1995","count":1},{"name":"短片","count":1}]}
