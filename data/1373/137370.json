{"id":137370,"type":2,"name":"Viaje a Marte","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3f/94/137370_aF774.jpg","summary":"　　This short animated piece captures the very spirit of film making...it is all real in the end. A young boy, after watching a serial about adventures to Mars decides he wants to go to Mars. The boy's grandfather, equipped with a special '56 Ford F-100 tow truck takes the boy to Mars. The boy returns to his home knowing he had been to Mars. Others doubt his story. Story telling is meant to inspirational (I don't mean the pallid goody-two-shoes sort of inspiration, rather inspiration -synonymous with moving, or activating). At its heart Viaje a Marte confirms that while the cold hard facts of our lives may be debatable, the ability to find a spirit to our dreams is what makes a life. Being animation this \"story\" is told through the narrative of the film, but as well through the brilliantly characterized faces (including the \"face\" of the F-100). See it if you can.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>前往火星</li><li><span>别名: </span>Journey to Mars</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2005-04-14</li><li><span>片长: </span>16min</li><li><span>语言: </span>西班牙语</li><li><span>导演: </span>Juan Pablo Zaramella</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Juan Pablo Zaramella</li>","collection":{"collect":2,"on_hold":1,"dropped":1}}
