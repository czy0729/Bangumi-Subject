There are perils: a boy falls, a lion roars. The lyric flights of hot-air balloons, flying machines, and dirigibles, and their accompanying music of the spheres, are sometimes interrupted by a jangling buzz. Circus images take over. Then, mechanical rhythms abound while a balloon-headed doll, perhaps alien, moves through a jungle scene. We end in a garden.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>星球女士</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1972</li><li><span>片长: </span>10min</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>无对白</li><li><span>导演: </span>Larry Jordan</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":5,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"1972","count":3},{"name":"短片","count":3},{"name":"Larry_Jordan","count":3},{"name":"美国","count":1}]}
