Schist claimed that Sallis had sold legally and escaped with the money, and asked the sheriff for help: Local protestors opposed his perfectly legal activities, and mestizo scoundrel Renee Laroque was sabotaging his facilities. Williams investigated this while at the same time trying to find an explanation to the missing people, some of which were found brutally murdered with plants growing from inside their bodies. Weirdo photographer Mike Ploog and shaman Pete Horn tell Williams local legends about the guardian spirit, suggesting that it could be real.\r\n\r\nAs sabotage and murder continue, Williams investigates the swamp with Fraser and finds the previous sheriff's corpse. Medical examiner Val Mayerik admits that the previous sheriff had ordered him to file the deaths as alligator attacks, even if Mayerik believed otherwise.\r\n\r\nWilliams and Fraser try to track Laroque, who lives in the swamp, by using a canoa. At the same time, Schist sends local thugs the Thibadeux brothers to track and murder Laroque. The monster in the swamp finds the Thibadeux and kills them. Williams is ensnared by Laroque, who admits having helped Schist buy the lands, but then claims that Sallis opposed to the sale; Laroque insists that the guardian spirit would keep on murdering until Schists stops desecrating the sacred swamp. Fraser tries to help Laroque, but the Man-Thing timely appears and murders Fraser; Laroque knocks Williams down and escapes. Williams wakes up and finds Ploog, who has blurry pictures of the monster; the sheriff seizes the photographs and forbids Ploog to come back to the swamp.\r\n\r\nThe following day, Williams interviews Horn and Schist, with schoolteacher Teri Richards' help, for whom he starts having romantic feelings.\r\n\r\nHorn goes to the swamp and tries to stop the Man-Thing with prayers and sacrificing his life but, although the monster kills Horn, he is not affected.\r\n\r\nThat night, Mayerik autopsies the old sheriff and finds a bullet. He tries to tell Williams, but he is back at the swamp, unreachable; he tells Richards, and she goes to the swamp to tell Williams. Meanwhile, Ploog had returned to the swamp, trying to get a picture of the monster, but instead he startles Fred Schist, who was in the swamp to murder Laroque – Schist shoots and kills Ploog. Soon afterward, Laroque ambushes and defeats Schist's son and minion Jake.\r\n\r\nWilliams finds Ploog's corpse and reasons that Schist murdered Ploog. He then meets Richards, who tells him about Mayerik's autopsy. Williams concludes that Schist is guilty of several murders, trying to incriminate Laroque simply to avoid punishment – in fact, by Schist's confession to Laroque, he murdered Sallis and buried him in Dark Waters (which, due to the magic embedded in the soil, made him go back as the Man-Thing). Richards reveals that she can guide him to Laroque's lair but the Man-Thing starts chasing them. He chases them to the drilling tower at Dark Waters, where Schist is leveling his weapon at Laroque in an attempt to prevent Laroque to blow it away with dynamite. Laroque nonetheless tries to detonate his bomb and is shot and wounded by Schist; Schist then wounds Williams.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Man-Thing arrives and brutally murders Schist by filling his body with oil. Then, the Man-Thing moves toward Williams and Richards. Laroque sacrifices himself shouting at the monster and blowing the bomb.\r\n\r\nThe monster survives the flames, but then is absorbed back to the land.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>类人体</li><li><span>原作: </span>《Man-Thing 》by Stan Lee、Roy Thomas、Gerry Conway、Gray Morrow、<a href=\"/person/6769\">Marvel Entertainment, LLC</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>非人类</li><li><span>集数: </span>1</li><li><span>开始: </span>2005-04-30</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国、澳大利亚、俄国、西班牙</li><li><span>每集长: </span>97m</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>www.scifi.com/manthing</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0290747</li><li><span>导演: </span>Brett Leonard</li><li><span>制片: </span>Avi Arad、Kevin Feige、Scott Karol、Christopher Petzel</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Hans Rodionoff</li><li><span>主演: </span>Matthew Le Nevez、Rachael Taylor、Jack Thompson、Conan Stevens</li><li><span>音乐: </span>Roger Mason</li><li><span>摄影: </span>Steve Arnold</li><li><span>剪辑: </span>Martin Connor、William Goldenberg</li><li><span>制作公司: </span>Marvel Enterprises</li><li><span>发行: </span>Lions Gate Films</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"怪物","count":2},{"name":"沼泽","count":2},{"name":"漫威","count":2},{"name":"恐怖","count":1},{"name":"电影","count":1},{"name":"欧美","count":1},{"name":"2005","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":511985,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/511985","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":6769,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/e1/45/6769_prsn_vXx5X.jpg","name":"漫威娱乐","desc":"原作"}]}
