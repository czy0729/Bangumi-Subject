The game was developed and published by Konami, and was released in North America in January 1992, in Japan on January 31, 1992 and in Europe on February 18, 1993.\r\nThe game required Bucky to rescue each of his crew members (except Bruiser, who is not featured in the game) on a series of planets. As each character was rescued, the player gained the ability to switch between them and Bucky on the fly to deal with different problems. Immediately after regaining his entire crew, they are once again captured and imprisoned on the Toad mother ship. Bucky and Blinky, sharing the same cell, break out and must rescue the remaining members. Afterwards, you continue through the ship.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>外星战将</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Bucky O'Hare</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>宇宙野兔</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年1月31日</li><li><span>设计师: </span>炭山智子</li>","collection":{"collect":8,"on_hold":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"FC","count":2},{"name":"ARCADE","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":747,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/c1/747_prsn_43cah.jpg","name":"科乐美","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":259608,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a3/9a/259608_NdjwM.jpg","title":"バッキー オヘア","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/259608"}]}
