Many ex-Capcom staff including Kouichi Yotsui (credited as Isuke), worked on the original arcade version of Strider and designed Osman as an unofficial sequel to Strider.[1] Yotsui directed both titles.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Strider's futuristic Kazakh-Soviet setting, Osman is set in a neon-lit cyberpunk Arabian setting, while Strider Hiryu is replaced by a Middle Eastern protagonist named Kirin who fights without any weapons.[2] 1UP.com included the game in its \"Games to Play Before You Die\" list.[3] The game's bizarre plot supposedly mocks director Kouichi Yotsui's experience at Capcom after Strider.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>铳武者</li><li><span>别名: </span>麒麟</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Osman</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARCADE","count":1}]}
