Rosie (Dania Ramirez), a single mother who left her son back in Mexico when her husband died, works as the housemaid/nanny for a pair of self-absorbed and successful actors, Peri and Spence. Aspiring singer Carmen (Roselyn Sanchez) hopes that her new pop star employer Alejandro can help kick start her career, but Odessa, his very loyal and humorless Russian housekeeper and her boss, will stop at nothing to stand in the way of her dreams. Zoila (Judy Reyes) is the senior maid for Genevieve, a co-dependent, drug-addicted, emotionally unstable wealthy woman. She works alongside her teenage daughter Valentina (Edy Ganem), who has a crush on Genevieve's son, Remi. Newcomer Marisol (Ana Ortiz), whose appearance, knowledge and lack of a Spanish accent does not fit the description of the four aforementioned maids, is hired to clean the home of Taylor, the insecure second wife to a wealthy man, named Michael, whose ex-wife is stalking him. The maids turn to one another for support when their friend and fellow maid Flora (Paula Garcés) is brutally murdered at the home of her employers, the shallow and secretive Evelyn and Adrian Powell, at the biggest society event of the year just moments after she was supposedly raped by Adrian, which Evelyn believed was a affair and blamed Flora for having seduced Adrian. A young waiter is found holding the bloody knife used in the killing at the scene and is arrested, but Flora in actuality was killed by another unseen person after she wrote a letter accusing the person of the crime. It is revealed at the end (unknown to both the other maids and their employers) that Marisol has infiltrated this inner high society circle to find out who set her son (the waiter) up.","status":"Air"},{"id":281310,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281310","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Setting The Table","name_cn":"","duration":"00:41:50","airdate":"2013-06-30","comment":0,"desc":"Spence begins to suspect that Peri is cheating on him when he finds underwear that doesn't belong to him, but Peri convinces Rosie to lie to him to cover for her. Rosie finds out that that Peri is indeed cheating with her co-star, but ultimately Rosie decides not to tell Spence because he reminds her of her late husband. Meanwhile, Carmen takes advantage of the house and her co-worker Sam, while Alejandro is away. Carmen reveals to Sam that she refuses to be in a relationship because her last boyfriend wasn't supportive of her dreams. Valentina bonds with Remi over their shared love of old movies and manages to ingratiate herself with his college friends. Zoila, disapproving of this, convinces Genevieve to throw a party where Remi's friends will see her at work. Afterwards Valentina admits her feelings to Genevieve who agrees to help her. Taylor refuses to let Marisol to continue working for the Powells because she considers them horrible people. Adrian (rightly suspecting that Marisol is not who she appears to be) convinces Taylor to let Marisol to continue to help them with the housekeeping. Marisol discovers Flora's note which Adrian immediately snatches. Marisol (who earlier in the beginning of the episode relived through flashbacks about how she began her quest to clear her son's name) visits her son in jail where he tells her that he and Flora dated and added that at the time of the murder the real killer knocked him out and placed the knife on him; Marisol, who also memorized portions of the note, believes it may hold a clue and tells her son she'll search for it. As Adrian reads Flora's letter, she accuses someone of not protecting her from an unknown man. Adrian immediately burns the note.","status":"Air"},{"id":281311,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281311","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Wiping Away the Past","name_cn":"","duration":"00:42:49","airdate":"2013-07-07","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":281312,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281312","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Making Your Bed","name_cn":"","duration":"00:42:11","airdate":"2013-07-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":281313,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281313","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Taking Out the Trash","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-07-21","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":281314,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281314","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Walking the Dog","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-07-28","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":281315,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281315","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Taking a Message","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-08-04","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":281316,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281316","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Minding the Baby","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-08-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":281317,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281317","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Scrambling the Eggs","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-08-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":281318,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281318","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Hanging the Drapes","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-08-25","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":281319,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281319","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Cleaning Out the Closet","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-09-08","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":281320,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281320","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Getting Out the Blood","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-09-15","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":281321,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281321","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"Totally Clean","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-09-22","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":97610,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9a/8f/97610_3da43.jpg","title":"Devious Maids (Season 2)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/97610"}]}
