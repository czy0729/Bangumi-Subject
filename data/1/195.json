In the game's seriously warped fantasy world, players will become the Overlord and get first-hand experience of how absolute power corrupts absolutely. You could be a regular run-of-the-mill Overlord. However, with incredible power at your disposal and a team of evil-minded impish critters, the Minions, on hand to do your bidding, how will you resist the temptation to be wonderfully despotic?!\r\n\r\nGo deeper into the Overlord's twisted world as the single-player expansion content opens a series of hellish new levels, each a supernatural abyss for the game's five kingdoms: Mellow Hills, Evernight, Heaven's Peak, the Golden Halls and the Ruborian Desert. Access to each abyss is via a portal, which opens once a kingdom has been successfully conquered and the previous ruler banished to a personal hell within. However it's not just the fallen heroes that have been dragged into the abyss: the Overlord's newly loyal peasants have also been taken down into hell too.\r\n\r\nWith the undead denizens of each abyss on the attack and threatening the Overlord's reign above ground, there's only one thing for it: assemble your minion army, descend into each abyss and embark on a fresh wave of tyranny in order to return the serfs to their homelands, defeat the fallen heroes once and for all, and claim the throne of each kingdom's underworld.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>霸王之地狱重生</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/39251\">Triumph Studios</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/16402\">Codemasters</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC/PS3/XBOX360</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ARPG</li>","collection":{"collect":8,"on_hold":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARPG","count":2},{"name":"PC","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":39251,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/0e/05/39251_prsn_jJxtt.jpg","name":"Triumph Studios","desc":"开发"},{"id":16402,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/09/72/16402_prsn_Dgpu7.jpg","name":"Codemasters软件有限公司","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":107212,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/86/d6/107212_KrrVP.jpg","title":"Overlord","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/107212"},{"id":30162,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/47/27/30162_mZBb1.jpg","title":"Overlord II","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/30162"}],"like":[{"id":2031,"name":"地牢围攻2","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/88/ef/2031_Sd222.jpg"},{"id":3776,"name":"寂静岭4 密室","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/21/19/3776_awDd7.jpg"},{"id":2397,"name":"粘粘世界","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/87/8d/2397_3163G.jpg"},{"id":677,"name":"上古卷轴IV：湮没","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/cf/5a/50545_JBmhX.jpg"},{"id":4309,"name":"鬼泣3","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f2/b5/4309_kB705.jpg"},{"id":2452,"name":"三位一体","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/28/b6/2452_Y2wz8.jpg"},{"id":9752,"name":"极品飞车9：最高通缉","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/95/a0/9752_t2hNF.jpg"},{"id":5966,"name":"神鬼寓言","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/95/c8/5966_n70mI.jpg"}]}
