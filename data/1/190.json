It was released worldwide in May 2008. Releases for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows were cancelled.\r\n\r\nThe game takes place in a dystopian future, where the Mantel Corporation rule the world with a drug called Nova-Keto-Thyrazine - also called Nectar, a \"nutritional supplement\" that enables soldiers to fight harder and smarter, but also induces a hallucinogenic effect, where soldiers are no longer cognizant of the real battlefield around them, instead viewing an idyllic, painless environment.\r\n\r\nThe game takes place over a three-day period as Mantel battles a group of rebels known as \"The Promise Hand\" which is led by Gabriel \"Skin Coat\" Merino, with the player assuming the role of Shane Carpenter, a 25-year-old Mantel soldier. After Carpenter witnesses the effect Nectar is having on his fellow soldiers, and after a twist in the storyline Shane then turns rogue and teams up with The Promise Hand to take on Mantel.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/8105\">Ubisoft Entertainment</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2008年5月20日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Free Radical Design</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"御堂孝典","count":1},{"name":"鬼畜眼鏡","count":1},{"name":"克御","count":1},{"name":"佐伯克哉","count":1},{"name":"动画","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":8105,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/0a/a5/8105_prsn_Ll0zI.jpg","name":"育碧娱乐","desc":"发行"}]}
