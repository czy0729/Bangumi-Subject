It is the third game in the Untold Legends series. Although set within the same universe, Dark Kingdom is unrelated in story to the first two games in the series. This was a strange decision as Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code made a story connection to Untold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade through mention of a main antagonist.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>未名传奇：黑暗王国</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ARPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2006年11月15日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Sony Online Entertainment</li><li><span>发行: </span>Sony Online Entertainment</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"东方","count":1},{"name":"初音","count":1},{"name":"卡牌","count":1},{"name":"游戏","count":1},{"name":"BRS","count":1},{"name":"动画","count":1},{"name":"斗符","count":1},{"name":"幻斗符","count":1}]}
