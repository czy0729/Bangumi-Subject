It is a sequel to Prehistorik 2, featuring similar graphics but a richer and different story, and additional non-player characters which, among other things, provide hints and a tutorial.\r\n\r\nThe game was later released for the Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo DSi (as a DSiWare release), with the latter being released in North America on February 15, 2010.\r\n\r\nThe Super NES version received positive reviews from critics with the story, sound and gameplay being praised. The Game Boy Advance and DSiware ports, however, have gotten mixed reviews.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>原始人大进击</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17965\">KEMCO</a>, Titus France</li><li><span>别名: </span>P-マン</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>P-Man</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GBA</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NDS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995年6月23日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Titus France</li>","staff":[{"id":17965,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6d/7b/17965_prsn_JtxEX.jpg","name":"KEMCO","desc":"发行"}]}
