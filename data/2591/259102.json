{"id":259102,"type":4,"name":"Road Rash 3D","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/03/b0/259102_Z7oOJ.jpg","summary":"The game plays similarly to previous games developed in the Road Rash series, which involves the player racing their motorcycle against other motorcyclists. Gameplay favors an arcade-like style, with little emphasis on realism. While racing, the player has the option of punching, or using weapons to attack other opponents, to slow down their progress. The ultimate goal is to place first in the race in order to earn money to upgrade the player's motorcycle. Conversely, the worst scenario is to finish last, which doesn't earn money, or be stopped by police officers, where the player actually loses money. Despite sharing many characteristics with past games in the series, Road Rash 3D puts a stronger emphasis on the racing aspect of the game, and less on combat.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>暴力摩托3D</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RAC</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1998年5月31日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"艺电","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":259101,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/1a/e1/259101_DX0Xp.jpg","title":"Road Rash 3","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/259101"},{"id":259103,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/de/23/259103_7s3FI.jpg","title":"Road Rash 64","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/259103"}]}
