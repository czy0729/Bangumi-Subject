The second installment of the series continues the story of Rami's adventures as the Keeper of the Secret Treasure (a sphere passed down through generations of Rami's family). Rami races Dr. Pon and new rival Himiko Yamatai for an ancient treasure that can be unlocked with six spheres. This game features animated cut scenes provided by Studio Pierrot, who also provided the animation for the cut scenes in the first game.\r\nThe game mainly consists of sidescrolling platformer stages. Two of the stages retain the shoot-'em-up style of the first game, but the lesser dragons can be obtained as bonuses only. Besides the platformer and shoot-'em-up stages, there are vertically scrolling special stages, an underwater stage and a rollercoaster stage, classifying the game as a multi-genre platformer.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>庆应游击队：活剧篇</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/41\">ビクターエンタテインメント</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/41\">ビクターエンタテインメント</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/39902\">多和田吏</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Keio Flying Squadron 2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Keio 2: Flying Squadron</li><li><span>平台: </span>SS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996年5月17日</li>","staff":[{"id":41,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b7/1a/41_prsn_ekqty.jpg","name":"ビクターエンタテインメント","desc":"开发"},{"id":39902,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/7c/04/39902_prsn_P8pk9.jpg","name":"多和田吏","desc":"音乐"}],"relations":[{"id":258403,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/59/d3/258403_6Z6NQ.jpg","title":"慶応遊撃隊","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/258403"}]}
