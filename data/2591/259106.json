{"id":259106,"type":4,"name":"Vectorman 2","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/73/5b/259106_P3jUb.jpg","summary":"The gameplay is similar to the previous game. Vectorman has a different set of weapons, including a pulse beam, energy shot, and supershot guns. Vectorman can also now transform into insect forms such as a fire ant, a rhino, and \"shield bug\" that repels attacks. Unlike the original Vectorman, the full-level transformations featured in this game are not used to combat bosses as that is left to the human-form Vectorman. There are 22 levels divided into seven parts in all.\r\nBefore Vectorman 2 was released, Sega Channel held a contest that allowed artists to draw a morph Vectorman. Judges then chose the best one to be transformed in Genesis art, as well as being put on the Sega Channel. Ten runner-up submitters won a copy of Vectorman 2.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>粒子斗士2</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>粒子战士2</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform (Run and gun)</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996年11月15日</li><li><span>开发: </span>BlueSky Software</li>","staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":256546,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ff/c6/256546_G55i5.jpg","title":"Vectorman","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/256546"}]}
