It was released in Japan and PAL regions, and was set to be released in North America, but it was cancelled. The series is based on the manga Hamtaro, written by Ritsuko Kawai.\r\nThe game involves an extensive plot. One day while playing outside, Bijou witnesses a great rainbow. The rainbow disappears and Prince Bo falls to the ground. The Prince states that he can make rainbows by using his umbrella. He tries to prove it to disbelieving Stan and the rest of the Ham-Hams, but realizes too late that the colors on his umbrella are gone. And thus, Hamtaro and his Ham-Ham friends must set off on a journey in order to collect things that are the proper color for Prince Bo to use for his umbrella so he can create a rainbow to return home.\r\nCertain minigames are needed to reach the colors, and the player must have certain Ham-Hams in their party in order to play them. For example, Sandy is needed to ride pigeons, Bijou is needed to collect falling petals, and Penelope is needed for rolling on top of cans to get across small streams. In addition to the original Ham-Hams, the game contains some additional characters, most of which were never seen in the English anime. These include Prince Bo, who is the prince of Rainbowland (a castle that is made of clouds); Flora, or Nurse-Ham; Tux; and other various characters.\r\nIn Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, two sevens, and one eight for a total of 30 out of 40.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>哈姆太郎4</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/35389\">ALPHADREAM</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/6734\">任天堂</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Hamtaro: Rainbow Rescue</li><li><span>平台: </span>GBA</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003年5月23日</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"GBA","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":35389,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ca/5e/35389_prsn_TFKt8.jpg","name":"AlphaDream","desc":"开发"},{"id":6734,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6f/d9/6734_prsn_ygMvd.jpg","name":"任天堂","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":18513,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/df/db/18513_86wK4.jpg","title":"とっとこハム太郎","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/18513"},{"id":259110,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/15/b7/259110_Q67IV.jpg","title":"とっとこハム太郎3 〜ラブラブ大冒険でちゅ〜","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/259110"}]}
