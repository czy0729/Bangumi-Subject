It is the third installment in the popular Driver series and was developed by Reflections Interactive and published by Atari. Driv3r was released in North America for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on June 21, 2004. In Europe, it was officially released on June 25, although due to the way Atari shipped the title across the continent, it made its way into independent UK retailers before the release date, even making a #6 position in the ELSPA chart for that week. On March 15, 2005, it was released on PC for US customers, it was also released on Game Boy Advance October 25, 2005. At one point a Nintendo GameCube version and an N-Gage version were planned, but both were canceled.\r\nDriv3r brings back features from Driver 2 and adds the ability to ride motorcycles and boats, use weapons, swim, climb ladders, and enter certain buildings among other things, controlling more than one character, as well as entering and exiting cars.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>极道车魂3</li><li><span>别名: </span>狂飙3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Driver 3</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GBA</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">游戏类型: </span>RAC</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2004-6-21</li><li><span>制作公司: </span>Reflections Interactive</li><li><span>发行公司: </span>Atari</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"GBA","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":50494,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/46/68/50494_fqQfC.jpg","title":"Driver 2: Back on the Streets","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/50494"},{"id":23486,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b0/37/23486_4VILx.jpg","title":"Driver：San Francisco","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/23486"}]}
