In 2010, St. Cloud parole officer Ray Stussy (Ewan McGregor) wants to marry his parolee girlfriend Nikki Swango (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and asks to borrow some money from his brother Emmit (also Ewan McGregor) to pay for a ring. Emmit refuses, and the brothers argue over their father's inheritance that they traded each other; in which, Emmit got a valuable stamp collection and Ray got a Corvette. Ray later blackmails another parolee, Maurice LeFay (Scoot McNairy), with a failed drug test and coerces him into stealing a stamp from Emmit. Maurice loses the address but remembers part of the Stussy address. Meanwhile, Emmit seeks to repay a loan from two years ago, only to be informed by a shady businessman named V.M Varga (David Thewlis) that the loan was actually an investment from a shady corporation. In Eden Valley, police chief Gloria Burgle (Carrie Coon) and her son leave her stepfather Ennis's (Scott Hylands) house but return for a forgotten gift to find him dead and the house ransacked. Maurice had mistakenly killed Ennis when he got a single word in the address wrong. He later goes to blackmail Ray, and Nikki and Ray kill him by dropping a window air conditioner on him."},{"id":702374,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/702374","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"The Principle of Restricted Choice","duration":"00:50:14","airdate":"2017-04-26","comment":1,"desc":"Curious about Varga, Emmit hires an investigator, whose internet searches cause his computer to crash and Varga's men to toss him off a parking garage. Varga then takes ownership of an unused wing of Emmit's offices. While managing with the introduction of a new Police Chief (Shea Whigham) and Ennis's funeral arrangements, Gloria learns that her stepfather wrote cheap science-fiction novels under the pseudonym \"Thaddeus Mobley\" (Thomas Mann). She also investigates the gas station that Maurice stopped in on the night of the murder and discovers he took the page in the phonebook where Ennis' information was, arousing her suspicions. Nikki suggests Ray make peace with his brother while she steals the stamp. He cordially visits Emmit and the two make peace, which gives Nikki enough time to search his home office for the stamp. However, Emmit had already put the stamp in a safety-deposit box presumably because he didn't trust his brother. Enraged, she leaves a used tampon in one of his desk drawers. Emmit finds out about this and reveals that he put it in the box because the frame is being replaced. Emmit's business partner Sy Feltz (Michael Stuhlbarg) meets with Ray the next day and tells him that he can no longer make contact with his brother and rams Ray's corvette twice."},{"id":702375,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/702375","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"The Law of Non-Contradiction","duration":"00:47:50","airdate":"2017-05-03","comment":1,"desc":"In Los Angeles in 1975, Thaddeus Mobley (Thomas Mann) is approached by film producer Howard Zimmerman (Fred Melamed) to adapt his award-winning novel The Planet Wyh. Zimmerman introduces him to actress Vivian Lord (Francesca Eastwood), who seduces him into also funding the film. After learning the two have conned him, Mobley severely beats Zimmerman. In L.A. in 2010, Gloria unwittingly checks into Mobley's former motel room and tracks down Zimmerman and Vivian (Frances Fisher). Both initially deny knowing Mobley, but Vivian ultimately reveals the con to Gloria. Back in the motel room, the dual timelines mirror each other, as Mobley and Gloria prepare to leave town. Mobley vomits in the toilet, Gloria drops some makeup beside it, and both see the toilet manufacturer's name: Dennis Stussy with a faded \"D\". Back in Eden Valley, Gloria learns that Maurice's fingerprints were identified, but he is dead. She resumes Ennis's murder investigation."},{"id":702376,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/702376","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"The Narrow Escape Problem","duration":"00:48:55","airdate":"2017-05-10","comment":1,"desc":""},{"id":702377,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/702377","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"The House of Special Purpose","duration":"","airdate":"2017-05-17","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":702378,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/702378","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"The Lord of No Mercy","duration":"","airdate":"2017-05-24","comment":4,"desc":""},{"id":702379,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/702379","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"The Law of Inevitability","duration":"","airdate":"2017-05-31","comment":1,"desc":""},{"id":702380,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/702380","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Who Rules the Land of Denial?","duration":"","airdate":"2017-06-07","comment":2,"desc":""},{"id":702381,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/702381","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Aporia","duration":"","airdate":"2017-06-14","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":702382,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/702382","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Somebody to Love","duration":"","airdate":"2017-06-21","comment":0,"desc":""}],"staff":[{"id":35104,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/d3/21/35104_prsn_K10T1.jpg","name":"Ewan McGregor","desc":"主演"}],"relations":[{"id":121589,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/45/02/121589_cks5x.jpg","title":"Fargo Season 2","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/121589"},{"id":234863,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/bb/d0/234863_ZBg4M.jpg","title":"Fargo Season 4","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/234863"}]}
