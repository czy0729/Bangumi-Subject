But he will also face an unexpected danger.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps, who knows? He will even find true love. It's up to you to decide if Alex will reach a happy ending or will leave St.Michaels with a broken heart… or maybe even worse.","info":"<li><span>游戏类型: </span>视觉小说</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2017年3月21日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$10.00 USD</li><li><span>开发: </span>Ertal Games</li><li><span>发行: </span>Ertal Games</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://ertal-games.itch.io/a-hand-in-the-darkness</li>","collection":{"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"西班牙","count":1},{"name":"2017","count":1},{"name":"BL","count":1}]}
