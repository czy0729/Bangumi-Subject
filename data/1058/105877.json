Designed and edited by Adrian Tomine, the first volume, \"The Push Man and Other Stories,\" debuted to much critical acclaim and rightfully placed Tatsumi as a legendary precursor to the North American graphic-novel movement. \"Abandon the Old in Tokyo \"continues to delve into the urban underbelly of 1960s Tokyo, exposing not only the seedy dealings of the Japanese everyman but Tatsumi's maturation as a story writer.","info":"<li><span>册数: </span>1</li><li><span>话数: </span>8</li><li><span>作者: </span><a href=\"/person/10056\">辰巳ヨシヒロ</a></li><li><span>出版社: </span>Drawn and Quarterly</li><li><span>价格: </span>USD 19.95</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2006年12月1日</li><li><span>页数: </span>224</li>","collection":{"wish":4,"collect":3,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"辰巳ヨシヒロ","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":10056,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/25/26/10056_prsn_fhkFB.jpg","name":"辰巳嘉裕","desc":"作者"}],"relations":[{"id":105789,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/14/76/105789_3pmv9.jpg","title":"TATSUMI","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/105789"}]}
