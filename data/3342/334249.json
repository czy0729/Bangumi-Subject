{"id":334249,"type":4,"name":"SiN","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/61/41/334249_00OHb.jpg","summary":"SiN is a first-person shooter video game developed by Ritual Entertainment and published by Activision in 1998. It uses a modified version of the Quake II engine. SiN is set in the dystopian future of 2037, where John Blade, a commander in a security force named HardCorps in the megacity of Freeport, is tasked to rid the city of a recreational drug that may be tied to the rival biotechnology megacorporation, SinTek.\r\n\r\nSiN was released to generally positive reviews, with praise going towards its level design and premise, but criticism for technical issues that resulted from a rushed release. It sold poorly as a result of competition with Half-Life, but grew to have a cult following.\r\n\r\nNightdive Studios acquired the rights to SiN in 2020, and in March 2020 republished the title, along with the Wages of Sin expansion pack, as SiN: Gold. Furthermore, the studio announced plans to release a remastered version, titled SiN: Reloaded, in 2021.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>原罪</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/41624\">Ritual Entertainment</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17518\">Activision</a>、<a href=\"/person/41623\">Nightdive Studios</a> (SiN: Gold and SiN: Reloaded)</li><li><span>别名: </span>SiN: Gold</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>SiN: Reloaded</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>原罪：黄金版</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Quake II engine</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1998年11月9日</li>","staff":[{"id":41624,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6c/ce/41624_prsn_0V0ub.jpg","name":"Ritual Entertainment","desc":"开发"},{"id":41623,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/02/00/41623_prsn_DeGjB.jpg","name":"Nightdive Studios","desc":"发行"},{"id":17518,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/cb/6c/17518_prsn_bBbhR.jpg","name":"动视","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":241964,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c2/53/241964_Bs61W.jpg","title":"SiN Episodes: Emergence","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/241964"}]}
