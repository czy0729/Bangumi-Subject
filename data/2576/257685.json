{"id":257685,"type":4,"name":"Super R-Type","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/71/a8/257685_1kM4K.jpg","summary":"Super R-Type borrows four stages from R-Type II and adds three new ones. The game is known for its high difficulty (even compared to other games in the series), particularly because of its lack of checkpoints, since dying means restarting the level from scratch. Also, this game suffers from slowdown, which was also a problem in many early games for this system. But unlike the others Super R-Type slows down to virtual standstill when there are many things on the screen. However, this proved useful for players when there were many obstacles on screen because it was easier to avoid them.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超级异型战机</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32197\">Irem</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32197\">Irem</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>スーパーファミコン</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>スーパー・アール・タイプ</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii VC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1991年7月13日</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"EN","count":1},{"name":"IREM","count":1},{"name":"SFC","count":1},{"name":"日本","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":32197,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ee/25/32197_prsn_E4Pv2.jpg","name":"Irem股份有限公司","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":93606,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/1a/a0/93606_9fe8a.jpg","title":"R-TYPE III","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/93606"},{"id":79570,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a2/a5/79570_1TUwf.jpg","title":"R-Type II","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/79570"}]}
