Conan can fight with sword and shield, two-handed weapons, or a weapon in each hand. Starting with several basic attacks, the barbarian gains experience points by killing enemies. By exchanging these points for additional attacks, players improve the hero's fighting abilities. Magic powers complement Conan's arsenal, including the abilities to turn enemies into stone and conjure firestorms. The game also features context-sensitive action sequences in which players press a sequence of buttons displayed on the screen to complete actions such as killing powerful enemies and interacting with the environment.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>野蛮人柯南</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/16404\">THQ</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PlayStation 3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2007-10-11</li><li><span>开发: </span>Nihilistic Software</li><li><span>CERO: </span>C</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt1132146</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"crt":[{"id":70944,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/fe/0d/70944_crt_esSIY.jpg","name":"柯南","desc":"主角"}],"staff":[{"id":16404,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b5/f5/16404_prsn_IwyQE.jpg","name":"THQ公司","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":288847,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/19/c1/288847_TSXFz.jpg","title":"Robert E.
