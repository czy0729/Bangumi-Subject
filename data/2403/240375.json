Featuring well over a dozen live performers and songs ranging the breadth of American music, from folk to bluegrass to big band jazz. Like America itself, this album is one big story, woven of many small ones. \r\n\r\n\"Working on this soundtrack has been a dream come true for a lot of reasons. I've always been really interested in how music can change and take on a life of its own as people share it, and getting to explore that idea with WTWTLW's world map theme (which shifts styles and influences depending on where you are in the country) was awesome. \r\n\r\nI'm also a big fan of how people from different backgrounds can come together to form one musical culture. I think American Folk music is one of the best examples of that, and writing this soundtrack meant I got to work with a ton of amazing performers from all over the country, including many I've been wanting an excuse to hire for a long time. Working on this game really crossed a lot of stuff off my musical bucket list!\" - Ryan Ike \r\n","info":"<li><span>作曲: </span>Ryan Ike</li><li><span>封面: </span>Kellan Jett</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>2018/02/28</li><li><span>价格: </span>$10</li><li><span>录音: </span>Laced Records</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":4,"doing":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"OST","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Soulsucker Blues","href":"/ep/782826"},{"title":"2 Breathe the Black","href":"/ep/782827"},{"title":"3 Vagrant Song (Deep South)","href":"/ep/782828"},{"title":"4 Miles of Smiles","href":"/ep/782829"},{"title":"5 Curandera","href":"/ep/782830"},{"title":"6 From This Field I Wish To Rise","href":"/ep/782831"},{"title":"7 Shining Isles of Ivory","href":"/ep/782832"},{"title":"8 Vagrant Song (Appalachia)","href":"/ep/782833"},{"title":"9 Noodle it Out","href":"/ep/782834"},{"title":"10 Dust to Dust","href":"/ep/782835"},{"title":"11 This Trench Was Dug for Me","href":"/ep/782836"},{"title":"12 Vagrant Song (Midwest)","href":"/ep/782837"},{"title":"13 Rail Hoppin'","href":"/ep/782838"},{"title":"14 Read 'Em And Weep","href":"/ep/782839"},{"title":"15 Tear it Down","href":"/ep/782840"},{"title":"16 Vagrant Song (Southwest)","href":"/ep/782841"},{"title":"17 The Road Remembers","href":"/ep/782842"},{"title":"18 Rainbow on Wheels","href":"/ep/782843"},{"title":"19 White Rider","href":"/ep/782844"},{"title":"20 Root and Rise","href":"/ep/782845"},{"title":"21 Vagrant Song (Northwest)","href":"/ep/782846"},{"title":"22 Howl","href":"/ep/782847"},{"title":"23 Heavy Hands","href":"/ep/782848"},{"title":"24 Vagrant Song (Midwest) (Instrumental Version)","href":"/ep/782849"},{"title":"25 Vagrant Song (Deep South) (Guitar Version)","href":"/ep/782850"},{"title":"26 Vagrant Song (Appalachia) (Guitar Version)","href":"/ep/782851"},{"title":"27 Vagrant Song (Southwest) (Guitar Version)","href":"/ep/782852"},{"title":"28 Tear it Down (Piano Version)","href":"/ep/782853"},{"title":"29 White Rider (Guitar Version)","href":"/ep/782854"},{"title":"30 Soulsucker Blues (Piano Version)","href":"/ep/782855"}]}],"relations":[{"id":277517,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9a/18/277517_03cKj.jpg","title":"Where the Water Tastes Like Wine","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/277517"}]}
