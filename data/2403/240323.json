As an alchemist, players will assume the role of Faust and have to raise varieties of homunculus to help growing the soul to revive his daughter. The game emphasizes on players building relationship with their homunculus, just to sacrifice them for his daughter.\r\n\r\nAs a simulation game, My Lovely Daughter borrows elements from other works of fiction that involve alchemy as part of the narrative. The game wants to focus on the idea that “life is not beautiful,” and the few things that can make it pretty are things like family and success. It also aims to present the question of how far will you go to achieve them.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38426\">Toge Productions</a>, Another Indie</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>模拟</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2018年3月9日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$14.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.togeproductions.com/project/mylovelydaughter/</li><li><span>开发: </span>GameChanger Studio</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":8,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":3},{"name":"猎奇","count":2},{"name":"合成","count":1},{"name":"游戏分类:SLG","count":1},{"name":"GameChanger_Studio","count":1},{"name":"R-18G","count":1},{"name":"indie","count":1},{"name":"独立游戏","count":1},{"name":"模拟经营","count":1},{"name":"模拟","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":38426,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/d6/e3/38426_prsn_fFgHF.jpg","name":"Toge Productions","desc":"发行"}]}
