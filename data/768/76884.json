Although the team initially assumed the deaths were caused by some form of weapon, the cause of the anomalies is discovered to be an alien virus found on a Chitauri helmet salvaged from the Battle of New York that turns the unwitting victims into electrostatic bombs. When Agent Simmons is infected by the fatal virus, she and Agent Fitz work feverishly on a cure, while Coulson ignores a direct order to sacrifice Simmons to save the rest of the team. With time running out and unaware their last attempt was actually successful, Simmons knocks out Fitz to leap from the plane, but Ward manages to save her before she plunges to her death. Simmons then receives a telling off from Agent Coulson. Once outside his office it is revealed that Ward heard their impressions of him.

Coulson goes to Skye and confesses that he discovered the drug used to revive them both was alien in origin based on his own suspicions and information provided by Sif. Despite how disturbed Coulson is by this fact, Skye remains optimistic, and Coulson swears that they will get answers, beginning by tracking down the Clairvoyant once and for all. He orders Skye to keep the origin of the drug a secret until Nick Fury gives them the truth. It is revealed that May is secretly monitoring him.

Several weeks later, they along with Agents Hand, Sitwell and Blake join the team in their hunt for the Clairvoyant. The agents split into teams to pursue leads on different Clairvoyant candidates. At a nursing home searching for Thomas Nash, a catatonic man who once claimed to be a psychic, May and Blake encounter Deathlok. Before critically injuring Blake before escaping, he claims that \"Mike Peterson is dead\" upon being reminded of his son. However, Blake manages to tag him with a tracker before he flees. Concluding that Nash is the Clairvoyant because of Deathlok's presence along with the falsifying of his nursing home records, the team converges on Deathlok's next location, an abandoned horse racing track, while Triplett and Simmons stay behind at the Hub with Hand. The team briefly encounters Deathlok again, but he flees into the sewers. However, they discover a hidden room where Thomas Nash (Brad Dourif), a vegetative man on life support who must speak through a computer, is hiding. Nash surrenders and boasts that as the Clairvoyant, he will always be watching them, but when he says that Project Centipede will kill Skye, Ward shoots him dead. Meanwhile, Fitz attempts to create a secret phone line so he can speak to Simmons from the Bus, but he discovers a bug that leads him to May's secure line. Coulson realizes that Thomas Nash was not the Clairvoyant, and when Skye presents the results of her studies on the S.H.I.E.L.D. psychological files of the potential Clairvoyants, they realize that the Clairvoyant is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. with access to the same files, giving the Clairvoyant knowledge of how to manipulate the agents. Coulson accuses the detained Ward of working with the Clairvoyant and shooting Nash to misdirect away from the Clairvoyant's true identity, but they are interrupted by Skye, who learned of May's unapproved phone line from Fitz. Coulson and Skye end up in a standoff with May in the Bus's hangar. But as May tries to explain that she cannot identify who the line goes to, control of the Bus is hijacked. At the Hub, Victoria Hand orders everyone aboard to be killed, except for Coulson.","status":"Air"},{"id":326324,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/326324","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"Turn, Turn, Turn","name_cn":"","duration":"00:42:47","airdate":"2014-04-08","comment":4,"desc":"Garrett's jet is attacked by S.H.I.E.L.D. drones after the Bus is hijacked, and he rejoins the team.

Coulson locks May up in the interrogation room with Ward, still believing she is the traitor. Skye discovers a secret code in a signal on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s network that she deciphers to reveal HYDRA's infiltration. When the Bus arrives at the Hub, the group splits into teams to capture Victoria Hand, whom they believe is the Clairvoyant, and save Simmons. Simmons and Triplett are captured by Hand, but she reveals that she is not actually part of HYDRA but believes that Coulson is, and recruits the two to aid her in stopping HYDRA. Coulson, May, Garrett, and Fitz manage to capture a computer room in the Hub, but while talking with Coulson, Garrett begins urging him to kill Hand without a trial and accidentally reveals information about Raina that Coulson never disclosed to anyone, unwittingly outing himself as the true Clairvoyant. In the ensuing battle, Coulson and May manage to kill the HYDRA agents and capture Garrett. The Hub is retaken and Captain America defeats HYDRA's trio of armed Helicarriers, but Nick Fury is presumed dead in the aftermath and the remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are forced to go on the run. Ward volunteers to accompany Hand to the Fridge so he can see to Garrett's imprisonment personally. However in transit, Hand offers Ward the chance to execute Garrett to atone for killing Thomas Nash by mistake. He at first appears to accept the offer, but then instead guns down Hand and the two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents with them, freeing Garrett and revealing himself to have allegiance to HYDRA.","status":"Air"},{"id":326325,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/326325","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"Providence","name_cn":"","duration":"00:42:48","airdate":"2014-04-15","comment":0,"desc":"Ward frees Raina from her confinement and introduces Garrett to her as the Clairvoyant.

He orders Skye to erase the identities of all the team members, including Ward. However, when Coulson collects the team's badges, he discovers a hidden message with coordinates in the Canadian wilderness. There they discover the hidden S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Providence, run by Agent Eric Koenig (Patton Oswalt). Coulson learns from Koenig that Fury is alive but is told to keep the information secret.
