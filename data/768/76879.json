After being pressured by his captain, he returns to active service and, against his will, is assigned a mandatory MX android as a partner to investigate a biotechnology robbery, which his captain suspects has been perpetrated by the Insyndicate, the same criminals who had ambushed him. He then throws the MX out from his moving car, destroying it. He is then assigned an old DRN unit called Dorian, whose software was based on a 'Synthetic Soul' program, which gave them emotions. Meanwhile, Detective Vogel (Toby Levins) is captured by the Insyndicate. With Dorian's help, Kennex gets an address from a captured robber. When the police raid the address, it turns out to be a set-up. Vogel is killed by a mysterious gas, while the robber is freed by his accomplices. Dorian later discovers that one of Vogel's case files, number 6663, is missing from the database. Technician Rudy Lom discovers that the criminals used the stolen biotechnology to create a weapon that targets cops specifically by attacking the mandatory inoculations they have in their bodies. Kennex decides to undergo treatment under the Recollectionist again to try to find more clues on the Insyndicate, and discovers that his ex-girlfriend Anna (Mekia Cox), was one of the criminals at the ambush. He then has a seizure, but is saved by Dorian. They discover the criminals are planning to steal evidence related to case 6663 at the police precinct. John warns the captain, but the criminals are already there and manage to disable all the MX units. The police are able to stop the attack on their headquarters and capture the leader, but due to the sabotage, they are not sure what the gang intended to steal. However, it is revealed that 6663 is in fact the head of a female android unit, which is seemingly still functional. Now more at ease and slowly warming up to his new partner, Kennex tells Dorian to call him by his given name."},{"id":339827,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/339827","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Skin","duration":"00:43:09","airdate":"2013-11-18","comment":2,"desc":"Kennex and Dorian investigate a murder of a man in a motel room and missing persons case involving robots, as it is discovered he makes synthetic skin for robot prostitutes, which are allowed as human trafficking has declined more than 40% since, and his work may have been in using real skin for the pro-bots.

It is later discovered the geneticist once was a specialist in cloning before legislation banned the science. When Kennex and Dorian are taking Maya to the precinct, they are intercepted by gunmen. Kennex kills one who is the spitting image of Ethan Avery, which leads to the belief that Avery knew Dr. Fuller because Fuller cloned Avery. Maya was shot in the shoulder and hospitalized, where she bonds and shares with Dorian. She got the procedure to be psychic to talk to her parents on the other side, but a fire destroyed their possessions, so now she never can. The gunmen found Maya because the MRX guarding the witnesses was destroyed and his police comm-link was taken. Det. Stahl goes to see Dr. Fuller's mother, where she finds the evidence of cloning, but is captured and used as a hostage by Avery's clones. Ethan killed Dr. Fuller because Fuller wanted to publish his findings. At the rendezvous, the clones see through the ploy and attempt to escape, only for Dorian to catch up and flip their van, killing the clones. Maya testifies and Avery goes to prison, Dorian visits Maya later and tells her that he looked into the arson case involving her parents.
