He offers to help the FBI find Ranko Zamani (Jamie Jackson), a long-thought-dead terrorist, but under one condition; he will only talk to new FBI profiler Elizabeth Keen (Boone), with whom he seemingly has no connection. Reddington informs her that Zamani will kidnap the daughter of General Daniel Ryker (Chance Kelly). The FBI retrieve the child, only for her to be kidnapped by a surprise attack on the convoy. Furthermore, Keen returns home to find Zamani beating her husband Tom Keen (Ryan Eggold), demanding to know what she knows of his upcoming attack. He then stabs Tom and escapes. As Tom recovers in hospital, Reddington asks Keen what Zamani revealed to her. Reddington later escapes to meet Zamani, who was instructed by Reddington to break into Keen's house. He places a tracker on Zamani so that Agent Donald Ressler (Klattenhoff) can kill him before the attack, which is revealed to be at a zoo. Keen finds the daughter with a chemical bomb strapped to her, which is disarmed by one of Reddington's associates. With the threat gone, Reddington reveals that he has intelligence to help the FBI find unknown threats he had gathered over the years. Meanwhile, Keen returns home and finds a box under a floor board, filled with money, a gun, and several passports with aliases, all with Tom's photograph.","status":"Air"},{"id":319958,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/319958","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"The Freelancer (NO. 145)","name_cn":"","duration":"00:40:16","airdate":"2013-09-30","comment":2,"desc":"Red predicts an impending catastrophe, rooted by the work of an assassin, called \"The Freelancer\".
