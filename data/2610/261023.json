Healing items are used to fix the attack robot and can be bought at a special warehouse. The player must go to the correct district for crime fighting action and the game refuses to send the player to the district that he isn't authorized to be in. The combat is handled from a third-person perspective in which the player must select commands (using buttons and not a menu screen) in turn-based combat in an attempt to defeat the enemy's mech.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/9162\">スティング</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Solid Runner</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>暗龙传说</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1997年3月28日</li><li><span>发行: </span>アスキー</li>","staff":[{"id":9162,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5c/af/9162_prsn_een11.jpg","name":"STING","desc":"开发"}]}
