The game was released as a paid-for early access title for Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on July 25, 2017, with a full free-to-play release announced in late 2018 but not yet released. The retail versions of the game were published by Gearbox Software, while online distribution of the PC versions is handled by Epic's launcher.\r\n\r\nFortnite is set in contemporary Earth, where the sudden appearance of a worldwide storm causes 98% of the world's population to disappear, and zombie-like creatures rise to attack the remainder. Fortnite has up to four players cooperating on various missions on different maps to collect resources, build fortifications around defensive objectives that are meant to help fight the storm and protect survivors, and construct weapons and traps to engage in combat with waves of these creatures that attempt to destroy the objectives. Players gain rewards through these missions to improve their hero characters, support teams, and arsenal of weapon and trap schematics to be able to take on more difficult missions.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>堡垒之夜：守护家园</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/18823\">Epic Games</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/18823\">Epic Games</a>、<a href=\"/person/17171\">Gearbox Software</a>（零售版发行）</li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/38433\">Rom Di Prisco</a></li><li><span>协力: </span><a href=\"/person/32731\">People Can Fly</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>要塞英雄：拯救世界</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS X</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Survival TPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unreal Engine 4</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2017年7月25日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$39.99 (Standard Founder's Pack)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">售价: </span>$59.99 (Deluxe Founder's Pack)</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/save-the-world</li><li><span>总监: </span>Darren Sugg</li>","collection":{"collect":3,"doing":1,"dropped":3},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"fortnite","count":1},{"name":"EPIC","count":1},{"name":"Gēmu","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":18823,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9d/96/18823_prsn_7CIcG.jpg","name":"传奇游戏","desc":"开发"},{"id":17171,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/86/9b/17171_prsn_7Q5F5.jpg","name":"Gearbox Software","desc":"发行"},{"id":38433,"image":"","name":"Rom Di Prisco","desc":"音乐"},{"id":32731,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/0d/8d/32731_prsn_ffQOF.jpg","name":"People Can Fly","desc":"协力"}],"relations":[{"id":234893,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/2e/84/234893_u8uV4.jpg","title":"Fortnite: Battle Royale","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/234893"}]}
