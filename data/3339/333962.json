The principal's daughter decides to look after the baby herself and try to find out what really happened to her former classmate. However, everyone around her seems oddly disinterested, and her search uncovers secrets that she didn't want to know--about Eunshil, her family, the whole village, and even about herself. This movie is a withering social statement about the darkest elements of rural life in South Korea.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>银实</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>别名: </span>Eun-sil-yee</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>给亲爱的你</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>宝贝</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Eunsilyi</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>The Dearest</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2012年3月8日</li><li><span>片长: </span>71分钟</li><li><span>导演: </span>金善雅、朴世熙</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>韩国</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"剧场版","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":1025607,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1025607","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
