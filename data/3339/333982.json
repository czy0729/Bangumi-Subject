It was the first game to use Monolith's flagship Lithtech engine. As well as performing missions on foot like other conventional FPS games, the game also allows the player to pilot a large mech.\r\n\r\nShogo features a mix of both standard on-foot first person shooter action, and combat with anime-style bipedal mechs. Unlike mech simulator games such as the MechWarrior series, the mechs in Shogo are controlled essentially the same as in first-person shooter games.\r\n\r\nAn inherent feature of the combat system in Shogo is the possibility of critical hits, whereby attacking an enemy will occasionally bring about a health bonus for the player while the enemy in question loses more health than usual from the weapon used. However, enemy characters are also capable of scoring critical hits on the player.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>升刚：机动装甲师</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32569\">Monolith Productions</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32569\">Monolith Productions</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>昇剛: モバイルアーマーディビジョン</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Macintosh</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Lithtech</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1998年10月15日</li>","staff":[{"id":32569,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/c8/99/32569_prsn_X8CCC.jpg","name":"Monolith Productions","desc":"开发"}]}
