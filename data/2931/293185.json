The game features numerous references to popular culture characters.\r\n\r\nMcPixel's objective in the game is to defuse bombs or \"save the day\" in 20 seconds each level. There are four chapters in the game, each with three levels and an unlockable level. Each level contains six sequences. Most of the time McPixel defuses bombs in absurd ways, mainly by kicking almost everything in the level.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2012年7月25日</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"indie","count":1},{"name":"STEAM","count":1}]}
