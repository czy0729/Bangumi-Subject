In a town crawling with bandits, murderers and bounty hunters you are an outlaw with a bounty on your head and everyone is gunning for you.\r\n\r\nIt is a downloadable, competitive twin-stick shooter focused on skill-based combat and uniquely abled characters. Players create and customize their own outlaw(s) before competing in one-vs-one duels, engaging in western-style gang fights, or entering the fray with the Free-For-All mode. As reputation points are earned, outlaws abilities will be able to be upgraded as the players in-game notoriety grows.\r\n\r\nThe game-play aggressively crosses genre boundaries, creating a distinctive and innovative feel. It brings together the strategic elements of overhead camera games, the team dynamics & matchmaking systems of 1st person shooters and the fast twitch responsiveness of a fighting game.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>神秘披风</li><li><span>别名: </span>神秘斗篷</li><li><span>平台: </span>Microsoft Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Steam</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Online multiplayer combat</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>PhyreEngine</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2014年12月2日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://secretponchos.com/</li><li><span>开发者: </span>Switchblade Monkeys Entertainment</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":3,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PS4","count":2},{"name":"Online","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}]}
