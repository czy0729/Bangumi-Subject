It retains the core gameplay of the series, as players race at top speeds through dozens of World Tour events testing \"reckless skill-based\" driving techniques. The versions for each platform do not interact with each other.\r\n\r\nThis is the only Burnout game that was not developed by Criterion Games,and the first Burnout game in the series since Burnout 2: Point of Impact to not feature the \"Crash Mode\". At the time Dominator was being developed, Criterion was busy working on Burnout Paradise and was waiting to re-introduce the mode in a new form for the latter title.However, Criterion Games are listed as \"the makers of this game\" in the game manual and credited as developer on the official Electronic Arts site.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>火爆狂飙 统治者</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PlayStation 2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PlayStation Portable</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RAC</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>RenderWare</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>Single-player, multiplayer</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2007年3月6日</li>","collection":{"collect":6},"tags":[{"name":"PSP","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"艺电","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":184621,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6f/f6/184621_yPZ97.jpg","title":"Burnout Revenge","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/184621"},{"id":621,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/85/fc/621_DSBBz.jpg","title":"Burnout Paradise","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/621"}]}
