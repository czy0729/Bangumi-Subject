His grandfather asked him to take care of a dead friend's family, which include four sisters and one brother. So now, in the first two months, he can chase after those four sisters, his maid, childhood girl, rival's sister or another vampire. The chasing is easy since he can check a location to see who is there before going, one advantage of a vampire I guess. In the later two months, he has to find a way to tell the girl he loves that he is a vampire and has to go through some obstacles to win her.\r\n","info":"<li><span>游戏类型: </span>ADV</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>System AQUA</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1999/07/15</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
