SSR agent Peggy Carter kills the spy and volunteers to receive the serum herself. She is successfully enhanced but banned from combat by SSR leader John Flynn. After she takes the Tesseract from Hydra with a vibranium shield from inventor Howard Stark, Flynn reluctantly promotes her to the combat role of \"Captain Carter\". Stark uses the Tesseract to create a weaponized, armored suit for Rogers to pilot as the \"Hydra Stomper\". Carter and Rogers fight many battles until he goes missing while attacking a Hydra train. Carter and her allies find Rogers when they infiltrate a Hydra base and see Red Skull using the Tesseract to open a portal and summon an interdimensional creature, which kills him. Carter enters the closing portal to force the creature back. Almost 70 years later, the Tesseract opens another portal which Carter emerges from, meeting Nick Fury and Clint Barton."},{"id":1042593,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1042593","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"What If...

He joins them to explore the galaxy. 20 years later, T'Challa has become a famous galactic outlaw mercenary, 'Star-Lord', while a reformed Thanos and Korath have joined the Ravagers roster. Nebula approaches the Ravagers, proposing to steal the Embers of Genesis, cosmic dust capable of terraforming ecosystems and eradicating galactic hunger, from the new galactic kingpin Taneleer Tivan. To get close to Tivan on Knowhere, they offer him the Power Stone Orb that T'Challa obtained from Morag. In Tivan's vast collection, T'Challa finds a Wakandan spacecraft sent to find him, revealing that Wakanda was not destroyed as Ravager leader Yondu Udonta claimed. Nebula seemingly betrays the Ravagers, leading to their temporary capture, as she executes a triple cross on Tivan to obtain the Embers. Tivan's slave Carina rescues T'Challa. The Ravagers and Carina defeat Tivan and his henchmen, the Black Order. Carina frees Tivan's numerous captives, leaving him at their mercy.

The Asgardians, led by Loki, arrive on Earth to avenge Thor; Fury proposes an alliance to apprehend the killer.

He discovers the Eye of Agamotto, which can manipulate time, but is warned by the Ancient One and Wong that doing so could destroy reality. Two years later, Strange repeatedly attempts to use the Eye to save Palmer, but she still dies in every scenario. The Ancient One tells Strange that Palmer's death is an \"absolute point\" in the timeline that cannot be undone, but Strange refuses to listen. Using the power of the Dark Dimension, the Ancient One splits Strange into two alternate versions: one Strange accepts Palmer's death while the other discovers how to gain power by absorbing mystical beings, becoming Strange Supreme. This evil version overpowers the good Strange, absorbs him, and uses his power to resurrect Palmer, tearing reality apart. Strange Supreme begs the Watcher for help, but he refuses to intervene. Palmer disintegrates and the universe collapses, leaving Strange Supreme to grieve alone."},{"id":1042596,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1042596","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"What If...

Returning to Stark Industries with Stark, Killmonger exposes Obadiah Stane's involvement in the ambush before helping Stark build a humanoid combat drone using vibranium. Needing more vibranium to create a drone army, they arrange for James Rhodes to purchase it from Ulysses Klaue. At Killmonger's behest, Klaue leaks word of the transaction to Wakanda to lure in T'Challa. Killmonger kills T'Challa and Rhodes, staging it to look as if they killed each other. Stark confronts Killmonger using the drone, but Killmonger defeats it and kills Stark, making it look like a Wakandan attack. Killmonger then kills Klaue before reuniting with his estranged family in Wakanda. Thaddeus Ross sends the completed drone army to attack Wakanda to avenge Rhodes and Stark, but Killmonger leads the Wakandans to victory. Afterward, Killmonger consumes the Heart-Shaped Herb and becomes the new Black Panther.
