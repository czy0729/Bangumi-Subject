Some of the time, they are pretty competitive against each other. Quacker appears only once in this series, with Don Messick voicing the duckling. The characters Toodles Galore, Butch, Lightning, Topsy, Meathead, Tyke, Tuffy, Mammy Two Shoes, Joan and George do not appear in this show. Also, Jerry wears a red bow tie in the series.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>新版猫和老鼠</li><li><span>话数: </span>16</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>1975-09-06</li><li><span>别名: </span>The New Tom & Jerry Show</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>The New Tom and Jerry Show</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>ABC</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>1975-12-13</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0130417</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":14,"doing":1,"on_hold":2,"dropped":4},"tags":[{"name":"1975","count":4},{"name":"童年","count":3},{"name":"TV","count":3}],"eps":[{"id":868946,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868946","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"No Way, Stowaways / The Ski Bunny / Stay Awake or Else...","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-09-06","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868947,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868947","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"No Bones About It / An Ill Wind / Beach Bully","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-09-13","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868948,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868948","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"The Mammoth Manhunt / The Wacky World of Sports / Robin Ho Ho","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-09-20","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868949,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868949","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Safe But Not Sorry / Gopher Broke / The Super Bowler","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-09-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868950,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868950","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Tricky McTrout / The Tennis Menace / Cosmic Cat and Meteor Mouse","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-10-04","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868951,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868951","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"The Castle Wiz / Grim and Bear It / The Flying Sorceress","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-10-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868952,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868952","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"The Kitten Sitters / Termites Plus Two / Planet's Pest","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-10-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868953,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868953","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"The Hypochondriac Lion / Give 'Em the Air / The Egg and Tom and Jerry","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-10-25","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868954,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868954","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Watch Out, Watch Dog / The Super Cyclists / The Police Kitten","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-11-01","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868955,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868955","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"The Outfoxed Fox / The Towering Fiasco / The Lost Duckling","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-11-08","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868956,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868956","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Beanstalk Buddies / Two Stars Are Born / Son of Gopher Broke","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-11-15","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868957,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868957","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"The Sorcerer's Apprentices / Hold That Pose / The Supercape Caper","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-11-22","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868958,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868958","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"Chickenrella / Double Trouble Crow / Jerry's Nephew","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-11-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868959,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868959","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"See Dr. Jackal and Hide / Planet of the Dogs / The Campout Cutup","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-11-29","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868960,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868960","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"Triple Trouble / The Bull Fighters / The Cruise Kitty","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-12-06","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":868961,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/868961","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"It's No Picnic / The Big Feet / The Great Motorboat Race","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1975-12-13","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"crt":[{"id":14401,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/61/bb/14401_crt_JciHA.jpg","name":"汤姆","desc":"主角"},{"id":14402,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/64/d1/14402_crt_1BReR.jpg","name":"杰瑞","desc":"主角"}],"relations":[{"id":25961,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/fd/60/25961_WDKz6.jpg","title":"Tom and Jerry","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/25961"},{"id":278572,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/85/26/278572_0b6aa.jpg","title":"The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/278572"}]}
