Whether it be in the mind of a single dreamer or a country as vast as the Warran Empire, if it is within the borders of your sfeer, all things shall come true. So it is that we have come to live in a cyclical world, and a cyclical world becomes a world of revolution. Thus let it be the duty of those with the Will, to make sense of all of this revolution. Within the sfeers of these men and women, all is subject to their will, and a will strong enough may change the fate of nations. They may change time itself. Let them be called cyclists, for all things come round in the end.”\r\n– PERCY CLAIRE,\r\nEXCERPT FROM THE CYCLICAL MANIFESTO","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>周天理论</li><li><span>出版社: </span>未出版</li><li><span>作画: </span>Chira</li><li><span>其他: </span>web comic</li><li><span>剧本: </span>Muun</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":1,"doing":2},"tags":[{"name":"Muun","count":1},{"name":"Chira","count":1},{"name":"SfeerTheory","count":1},{"name":"英文网漫","count":1},{"name":"webcomic","count":1}]}
