When he gets his letter, Robert believes it is because he once appeared in porn films and asks for Brian, the actor playing the role of the evil queen in the panto to prevent Debbie, the dim actress playing Snow White from finding out. Mr. Jelly entertains at a child's birthday party and believes that his letter comes from the similarly named act Mr. Jolly. Joy teaches some parents-to-be about giving birth while looking after her own \"baby\" Freddy. Lomax is offered help from a new social worker whom he names \"Tealeaf\", who stumbles upon his vast collection of \"commodities\". David is offered work playing the role of a butler at a murder mystery evening, but when he creates a more realistic murder, he gets fired.

Lomax has now discovered that someone is selling him online and he intends to buy it, but he finds himself in a bidding war with the Crabtree sisters. As they put in even bigger amounts of money, the people selling Snappy withdraw him from sale in the hope of making even more money. Elsewhere, Robert and Debbie go on a date, which is later discovered to be a trick. David and Maureen visit the man who organised the murder mystery evening, Graham. When he tries to call the police, David and Maureen plan to drown Graham in his bath. Graham escapes, but is run over by a bus and killed as he flees.

Mr. Jelly decides to visit Mr. Jolly to find out why he has been sending the messages. In a flashback, it is shown that Jolly was originally a doctor, Dr. Stuart Strachen, who operated on Jelly's hand, which had to be amputated. This injury resulted in him having to use hooks which scared the children he is entertaining and thus he becomes less successful. Over time, Dr. Strachen developed an interest in Jelly's work and becomes a children's entertainer himself, becoming even better than Jelly. The two fight in a children's play area and eventually Jelly demands to know why Jolly has been sending the letters. However, it turns out that the \"E\" in the name of the address is an \"O\" and the letters were meant to be sent to Jolly. Meanwhile, David and Maureen visit another member of the murder mystery evening who they murder via electrocution. Robert takes out his revenge on Debbie by using his telekinetic powers to knock her unconscious. Lomax and the Crabtree Sisters travel to Dudley in order to buy Snappy the Crocodile, but it has gone missing. Joy's husband George demands that she stop treating Freddy as if he is real, but as he does so, Freddy appears to move of his own free will.","status":"Air"},{"id":71767,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/71767","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"David and Maureen","name_cn":"","duration":"00:29:28","airdate":"2009-07-09","comment":1,"desc":"David and Maureen kill another member of the murder mystery evening and hide the body in a wooden chest.

A policeman, Jason Griffin, then visits the scene of the crime and David pretends to be the murder victim while he and Maureen try to bluff their way out of the situation. It is later revealed that Griffin is actually an actor auditioning for a role in the murder mystery evenings, but before Maureen learns this she tells him that it was in fact her who killed David's father by poisoning him slowly over time and that David's overdose was the final blow. As Griffin leaves, he tells David about what Maureen said about her committing his father's murder. As David confronts her, Griffin returns to get his coat and discovers the body. As a result, David murders Griffin as well.\r\nThis episode is a homage to the Alfred Hitchcock film Rope, in that it appears to be shot in one continuous take even though it was actually filmed in two.","status":"Air"},{"id":71768,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/71768","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Joy","name_cn":"","duration":"00:29:03","airdate":"2009-07-16","comment":0,"desc":"The black gloved man sends a final message to his victims, by giving them a key depicting a raven with a note saying, \"I'm waiting\".

As Robert confronts Kerry, she prevents him from escaping and uses some pick axes to attack Debbie. She then reveals that it is her, not Robert, who is telekinetic and demands that he leave Debbie and admit that he loves her. As Robert attempts to escape, the rest of the cast arrive to save Debbie thinking that Robert has gone mad. Brian knocks Robert unconscious and then Kerry drives him to the countryside. Meanwhile, Mr. Jolly tells Mr. Jelly to meet him at Jelly's house as he has important information, but when he arrives he finds Jolly is dead, with his head in a blue plastic bag. He discovers that the murderer is the black gloved man, who attempts to frame Jelly for the crime. Jelly decides his best option is to flee to Ravenhill.

The car that Kerry is driving runs out of petrol so they walk, finding a cottage. As Robert has some soup while Kerry makes a phone call, he discovers the telephone wire is cut and that Kerry has tricked him. He has also been drugged by the soup, served to him by an old crone. Lomax arrives at Ravenhill where he meets Joy and also finds Tealeaf who gives him Snappy. Lomax then throws Snappy over a cliff, and explains that he was in Ravenhill because he was suffering from Leisure Sickness after completing his collection the first time around. As a result, the only way to cure it was to get rid of Snappy. Mr. Jelly also arrives at Ravenhill, where he meets Joy and Lomax. They hear the sound of David singing and make their way to him, but it is in fact the video tape and they are trapped by the black gloved man. David meanwhile visits Kenchington's grave and discovers her coffin is empty. Kenchington is still alive, having not being killed by David and the others. Kenchington shoots David and leaves the graveyard, which is in the Ravenhill grounds. David however survives due to the item he is carrying in his blue plastic bag – a melon. The black gloved man reveals himself to be Mr. Jolly (he faked his death and used a fake head), who is actually Kenchington's son. He blames Joy, Lomax, Robert and David for killing her, and Jelly most of all because he was operating on his hand while she died, meaning Jolly was unable to save her. Kenchington then arrives revealing that she is not dead and that she wants to know which one of them stole a locket belonging to her. While a fight breaks out, Jolly reveals that he is wearing a bomb-covered vest as his method of getting his revenge on his mother's murder and he blows up part of the hospital with all of them inside and David outside. The locket is eventually shown to be worn by Robert.","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":32252,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/2b/ae/32252_W28cZ.jpg","title":"Psychoville (Series 2)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/32252"},{"id":85313,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/82/4a/85313_LEwM9.jpg","title":"Psychoville Halloween Special","type":"番外篇","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/85313"}],"like":[{"id":24790,"name":"男子高中生的日常","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c5/73/24790_4wdXB.jpg"},{"id":311,"name":"千与千寻","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9d/fc/311_GAg3x.jpg"},{"id":7770,"name":"神探夏洛克 第1季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c8/02/7770_ovO8O.jpg"}]}
