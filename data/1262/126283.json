Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is again reassigned to the FBI Academy and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) becomes John Doggett's (Robert Patrick) new FBI partner at the X-Files office. Doggett asks Scully for help on a case involving an EPA official, Carl Wormus (Nicholas Walker), who died after his car was forced off a bridge by a woman he picked up. Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) travel to a reclamation plant, to find any links between Wormus' work and death. After doing an illegal autopsy on Wormus, Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) sends Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) to locate Doggett. The investigation at the reclamation plant leads to an unknown woman, whose identity is later found to be Shannon McMahon (Lucy Lawless), one of Doggett's former Marine associates. She reveals to Doggett that she is a \"Super Soldier\". This leads them to a clandestine laboratory where a secret experiment is taking place on board on a naval ship. They later find connections with the experiments on the ship to Scully's child, William.\r\n\r\nHopeful about reuniting with Mulder, a complete stranger offers his service to drive Mulder out of hiding. Scully takes the offer, but unknowingly gets herself and Mulder in even more danger. The \"Shadow Man\" (Terry O'Quinn), a government agent, follows Scully. It is then discovered that he is a \"Super Soldier\" bent on killing Scully and Mulder. As confirmed in this episode, a \"Super Soldier\"'s only weakness is magnetite, which leads to the death of the \"Shadow Man\". Later on, Scully, Doggett and Reyes find evidence of a dangerous UFO cult which has found a second spacecraft similar to one Scully studied in Africa two years ago (as seen in \"The Sixth Extinction\"). Misled by the FBI, the agents enlist the help of The Lone Gunmen to protect Scully's son after they learn that the UFO cult apparently intend to kill the child. Doggett is run over by a car, leading him to be sent to the local hospital. As Follmer and the \"Toothpick Man\" (Alan Dale) are trying to uncover the plans of the three agents, Scully and Reyes leaves Washington, D.C. to find Scully's son.\r\n\r\nDoggett finds a strange disfigured man in the X-Files office; believing he is Mulder, they test his DNA. The test reveals him to have the same pattern as Mulder. The disfigured man sticks a needle into William, which the other agents believe to be a virus of some kind, but is later revealed to be a cure for William's powers. The unnamed man is later unveiled to be Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), Mulder's half-brother. Mulder returns from hiding to only be discovered looking for classified information at an army base and, after allegedly killing an apparently indestructible \"Super Soldier\", he is placed on trial to defend the X-Files and himself. But with the help of Kersh, Scully, Reyes, Doggett, Spender, Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden) and Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka), Mulder breaks out. Mulder and Scully travel to New Mexico to find an old \"wise man\", who is later revealed to be the \"Cigarette Smoking Man\" (William B. Davis). The Smoking Man is later killed by commands from Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin). The series concludes with Skinner attempting to contact Kersh who has been forced to close down the X-Files. Doggett and Reyes are last seen driving off into the desert after aiding Mulder and Scully, who are now on the run from the FBI and are last seen together in a motel room facing an uncertain future.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>X档案 第九季</li><li><span>主演: </span>Gillian Anderson、<a href=\"/person/40588\">Robert Patrick</a>、Annabeth Gish、Mitch Pileggi、David Duchovny</li><li><span>集数: </span>20</li><li><span>开始: </span>2001-11-11</li><li><span>结束: </span>2002-05-19</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>USA</li><li><span>电视台: </span>Fox</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":4,"doing":1,"on_hold":2,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"Fox","count":3},{"name":"x档案","count":1},{"name":"美剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":484987,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484987","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":484988,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484988","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":484989,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484989","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":484990,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484990","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":484991,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484991","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":484992,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484992","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":484993,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484993","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":484994,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484994","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":484995,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484995","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":484996,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484996","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":484997,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484997","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":484998,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484998","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":484999,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/484999","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":485000,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/485000","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":485001,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/485001","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":485002,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/485002","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":485003,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/485003","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":485004,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/485004","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":485005,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/485005","type":0,"sort":19,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":485006,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/485006","type":0,"sort":20,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":40588,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/cb/1e/40588_prsn_kNisD.jpg","name":"罗伯特·帕特里克","desc":"主演"}],"relations":[{"id":126282,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e1/3f/126282_N9RwR.jpg","title":"The X-Files (season 8)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126282"},{"id":142971,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/07/18/142971_aVHSM.jpg","title":"The X-Files (season 10)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/142971"}]}
