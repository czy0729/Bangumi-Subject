It is the sequel to Super Mario Land and also marks the debut of Wario. Like its predecessor, it received a Player's Choice and was produced by the late Gunpei Yokoi rather than the Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who wasn't involved in the development of this game.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超级马里奥大陆2 6枚金币</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/6734\">任天堂</a></li><li><span>QC: </span><a href=\"/person/39593\">木村浩之</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</li><li><span>平台: </span>GB</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992.10.21</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":12,"doing":1,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"Platform","count":2},{"name":"GB","count":2},{"name":"马里奥","count":1},{"name":"nintendo","count":1},{"name":"任天堂","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":6734,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6f/d9/6734_prsn_ygMvd.jpg","name":"任天堂","desc":"发行"},{"id":39593,"image":"","name":"木村浩之","desc":"QC"}],"relations":[{"id":156915,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/18/ec/156915_zVVW6.jpg","title":"THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY SUPER MARIO BROS.
