Unlike preceding platform games of the Mario series, the game takes place in Sarasaland rather than the Mushroom Kingdom. Super Mario Land also introduced the character Princess Daisy, this game's damsel in distress. An evil alien named Tatanga is the main villain, and most enemies in the game are not related to creatures found in earlier Mario games. Unlike the Super Mario Bros. games, Super Mario Land was not developed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo's EAD division but by Nintendo R&D1, with Gunpei Yokoi as guiding producer. \r\n\r\nThe game is the first (and shortest) of the three Super Mario Land games, its sequels being Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins and Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超级马里奥大陆</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/6734\">任天堂</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Super Mario Land</li><li><span>平台: </span>GB</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1989.4.21</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":24,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"GB","count":3},{"name":"ACT","count":3},{"name":"童年","count":3},{"name":"任天堂","count":3},{"name":"Platform","count":2},{"name":"平台动作","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":6734,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6f/d9/6734_prsn_ygMvd.jpg","name":"任天堂","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":156915,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/18/ec/156915_zVVW6.jpg","title":"THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY SUPER MARIO BROS.
