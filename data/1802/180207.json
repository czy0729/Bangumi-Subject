The early access version was released for Microsoft Windows on Steam on November 25, 2014, and the completed game was released on August 16, 2017.\r\nInspired by Mega Man X, players must shoot or slash enemies and complete difficult platforming challenges to finish a stage. The twist is that these stages are generated randomly based on level segments, or \"chunks\", and also allow for both local and online co-op. Rather than giving you several lives, the game has permadeath, but is a \"roguelite\" in that you can use Soul Chips earned during the level to unlock new types of passive upgrades to buy, and gain upgrades for the next attempt of that particular run.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>20XX</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2017年8月16日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$14.99</li><li><span>开发: </span>Batterystaple Games</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":9,"on_hold":1,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"ACT","count":2},{"name":"2017","count":1},{"name":"Rougelike","count":1},{"name":"☆","count":1},{"name":"Platform","count":1},{"name":"EPIC","count":1},{"name":"roguelike","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":300243,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/28/32/300243_CDPf2.jpg","title":"30XX","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/300243"}]}
