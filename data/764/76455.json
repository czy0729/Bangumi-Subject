McCann tells him to kill Katia and dump her in the river. Geddes takes her instead across the Canadian border and releases her to another man after telling her not to return to Detroit nor contact Agnew. He then regrets not killing her. Raymond LeFevre (Richard Goteri) is questioned by Geddes and Agnew after he claims to have seen two men put McCann's car in the river. He cites some pertinent details, some not released to the press, but because of his responses to some of Agnew and Geddes' questions and skeletons in his closet, he is deemed to not be credible, though his arrival pushes the homicide investigation forward. After Alexander Skelos (Alon Moni Aboutboul) gets called in for questioning, he goes to tell Maya not to use The International bar as their crime hub. She voices her concerns about him to Damon.","status":"Air"},{"id":287100,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/287100","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Catacombs","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-09-01","comment":1,"desc":"Agnew's search for Katia proves fruitless, but he renews a friendship with a former cop-turned-addict (Trevor Long).

Agnew's boxer, Trey (Kamal Angelo Bolden), wins his match and is cheered by the homicide department. Afterwards, Kahlil attempts to kiss Agnew and apologizes when denied. Poppa T (Samuel A.
