It was developed by Ancient—a studio founded by composer Yuzo Koshiro for the project—and published by Sega to promote the handheld Game Gear. The game is similar in style to its Genesis predecessor, but reduced in complexity to fit the 8-bit systems. It was released for the Game Gear on December 28, 1991, and for the Master System around the same time. It was later released through Sonic game compilations and Nintendo's Virtual Console.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>刺猬索尼克 8位机版</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/36047\">エインシャント</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Sonic the Hedgehog (8-bit)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>刺猬索尼克 8-bit版</li><li><span>平台: </span>Master System</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GG</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>VC (3DS, Wii)</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1991年10月25日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":36047,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/70/15/36047_prsn_NZJgN.jpg","name":"エインシャント","desc":"开发"},{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":261184,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/54/0b/261184_Pz0AR.jpg","title":"Sonic the Hedgehog 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/261184"},{"id":19173,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5b/d7/19173_YU86y.jpg","title":"Sonic the Hedgehog","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/19173"}]}
