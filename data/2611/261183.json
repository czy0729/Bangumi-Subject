Due to the discontinued support of the console in Japan and North America because of its lukewarm sales in both regions when compared to the Nintendo Entertainment System, the game was only released in Europe, Australia and other PAL territories, bearing the Ninja Gaiden label instead of the Shadow Warriors one that usually was used for the series by the time in PAL releases.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>忍者外传</li><li><span>开发: </span>SIMS、<a href=\"/person/17914\">Team NINJA</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Ninja Gaiden (Master System)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>忍者外伝</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>忍者龙剑传</li><li><span>平台: </span>Master System</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年7月</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":17914,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/66/56/17914_prsn_6U7HR.jpg","name":"Team NINJA","desc":"开发"},{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":72804,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/da/22/72804_XaTtZ.jpg","title":"忍者龍剣伝","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/72804"}]}
