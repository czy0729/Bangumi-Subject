It is not to be confused with \"Power Strike II\" for the Game Gear, which despite the identical name, developer and year of release, is an entirely different game, being a localization of GG Aleste II instead.\r\nPower Strike II takes place in an alternative past, fusing 1930s aircraft with futuristic technology seen in other Compile shooters. It was only released in PAL regions.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>强力打击II</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32942\">コンパイル</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Master System</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>纵版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年9月</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":32942,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5a/9e/32942_prsn_MIk3k.jpg","name":"Compile","desc":"开发"},{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"发行"}]}
