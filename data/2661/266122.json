{"id":266122,"type":4,"name":"Concordia","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/80/61/266122_zb354.jpg","summary":"Concordia is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-5 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:\r\nThey allow a player to choose actions during the game.\r\nThey are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.\r\nConcordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent's moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities. (One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.) When all cards have been sold or after the first player builds his 15th house, the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, etc.) wins the game.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>和谐罗马</li><li><span>别名: </span>康考迪亚</li><li><span>平台: </span>桌游</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Board game</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>2 - 5人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2013年</li><li><span>发行: </span>PD-Verlag</li><li><span>游玩时间: </span>100分钟</li>"}
