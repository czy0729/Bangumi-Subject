This is challenging due to the hazardous environments the animals exist in—the players must defend their flock against hungry predators, avoid pits of death, and send their animals flying with catapults. There are 55 single-player levels that span across three seasons: summer, autumn, and winter. There is also a cooperative play mode.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>XBox 360</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PlayStation 3</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Puzzle</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>Single-player, Multiplayer</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2009年4月7日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.motherflocker.com/</li><li><span>开发: </span>Proper Games</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"发行"}]}
