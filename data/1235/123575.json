In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships, better known simply as Gulliver's Travels (1726, amended 1735), is a novel by Anglo-Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, that is both a satire on human nature and a parody of the \"travellers' tales\" literary subgenre. It is Swift's best known full-length work, and a classic of English literature.\r\n\r\nThe book became popular as soon as it was published. John Gay wrote in a 1726 letter to Swift that \"It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery.\" Since then, it has never been out of print.\r\n\r\nCavehill in Belfast is thought to have inspired part of book two of the novel. Swift imagined that the mountain resembled the shape of a sleeping giant safeguarding the city.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>格列佛游记</li><li><span>出版社: </span>Swift House</li><li><span>价格: </span>$11.95</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2012-03-20</li><li><span>页数: </span>296</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>1613822847</li><li><span>作者: </span>Jonathan Swift</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":19,"doing":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"小说","count":6},{"name":"奇幻","count":3},{"name":"讽刺","count":3},{"name":"英国","count":2},{"name":"名著","count":2},{"name":"文学","count":1},{"name":"其它","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":173596,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/fc/a6/173596_us.jpg","title":"Gullivera","type":"书籍","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/173596"},{"id":112698,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0c/d1/112698_Pyyk6.jpg","title":"Gulliver's Travels","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/112698"},{"id":298,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/26/e3/298_l62bL.jpg","title":"天空の城ラピュタ","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/298"}]}
