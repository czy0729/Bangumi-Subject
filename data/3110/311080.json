It is about two families whose trajectories collide in the Arizona desert in 1999. Most stories start at the beginning, but this story starts in the middle, gradually widening outward to encompass multiple points of view over a thirty year span; a story spiral that explores the past, present and future of a single dramatic night.\r\n\r\nCan you break free of the influence of a toxic, but loving, family?\r\n\r\nCan you start over by moving home or changing jobs?\r\n\r\nCan you overcome your past?\r\n\r\nThese questions explore the universal themes of legacy, resilience and sacrifice. By playing As Dusk Falls, you will experience these everyday dilemmas first-hand and decide how you want to shape the fate of real, flawed people who are trying to find their way in a world they don’t fit in.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/16859\">Xbox Game Studios</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Xbox Series X/S</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Interactive drama</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>未定</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.asduskfalls.com/</li><li><span>开发: </span>INTERIOR/NIGHT</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":16859,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/cd/16859_prsn_48aP4.jpg","name":"Xbox游戏工作室","desc":"发行"}]}
