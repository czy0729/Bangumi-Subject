Hamburgers, omelets, sushi, pudding, anything. Let us cook your favorite dish when you were alive.\r\n\r\nThis is a story about a \"Bear\" and a \"Cat\". You are a \"Cat\", the assistant of a \"Bear\", who is the chef of the restaurant. Players can know about the customer's favorite dishes by \"diving\" into their memories... but in fact, you yourself do not remember who you are. Not even your favorite dish.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficult puzzle, no exciting battle, no epic cut scenes. But, you will remember their episodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Warning] This game contains potentially distressing materials, such as traffic accident, suicide and murder. However, there is no gore.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>熊先生的餐厅</li><li><span>平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ADV</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2018-11-09</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://daigostudio.com/bearsrestaurant/en/</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"互动剧情","count":1}]}
