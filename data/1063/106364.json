While testing it on his reticent son Pietre, he conducts a macabre experiment on a pet rabbit in an attempt to get a response from his child. He believes he has failed until his pregnant wife buys Pietre a rabbit which, only a short time after having it, their son kills. His wife kicks him out. A few months later she dies in childbirth, and Carvel raises his daughter Jessica up himself. Five years later, without telling Milner, Carvel adjusts the virus formula. Milner and the assistant are desperate for Carvel to give them the formula, and in the process kill several politicians who Carvel has been turning to for help. Milner tortures Carvel to find out what has changed. He escapes and injects the virus into Jessica in secret.","status":"Air"},{"id":406867,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/406867","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Episode 2","name_cn":"","duration":"00:50:38","airdate":"2014-07-15","comment":1,"desc":"Jessica is held prisoner and tortured by Milner, to try and find out the adjustment to the virus.

He then goes back home and kills his family and himself. Ian goes to look for Dugdale, only to find an excited Jessica at his house and they sleep together. Milner reveals to Wilson a man working at a shopping mall restaurant as an agent, who will when ordered to, fly a plane with a canister inside exposing the flu to the United Kingdom. Milner asks the man if he is scared that he will die, and he will cause the death of thousands of people, to which the man replies no. Milner reveals that there are other people in the world who will be doing the same thing, and cause a world-wide pandemic, and people will rush for the vaccine and only 9 in 10 people will be unknowingly infected with Janus, and become infertile. Becky tells Grant that Anton is Carvel, and they hire an interpreter to tell them what Carvel is saying when he speaks Romanian. It is revealed that Carvel is Jewish, and when he was five, he escaped a gas chamber in from a concentration and hid in dead bodies for two days, only to later meet 'Mr Rabbit' who was a wonderful woman. Ian, Becky and Grant are shocked as they believed Mr Rabbit was dead, and not a woman. They also find out about the sleeper agents, and how the flu is ready to be spread across the world. Milner holds Ian's brother Roy captive, and asks him if Ian told him that 'Milner is Mr Rabbit', Roy says no, and Milner tells Wilson to shoot him. Dugdale's wife and young Alice are revealed to be in captive. Carvel Jessica tells Dugdale that Milner is Mr Rabbit, and later Milner appears at Dugdale's house, ready to kill him, but Jessica stops her and almost shoots her before Milner reveals that her father is alive, and she will take Jessica to him. Carvel then speaks English, in shock to them all and tells them that the change in Janus is a race, but before he tells them Arby appears and shoots the interpreter and is about to kill Ian and Becky before Grant stops him. Arby then takes Grant and Carvel away.","status":"Air"},{"id":406870,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/406870","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Episode 5","name_cn":"","duration":"00:48:38","airdate":"2014-08-05","comment":0,"desc":"A man working at a fast food restaurant is abused by a customer, who asks if this is what he wants to do in life. The man goes home, and is revealed to be a sleeper agent. He packs several different passports and money into a bag, ready for when he gets a call to spread Russian flu. Arby takes Grant and Carvel to the countryside. After disposing of the interpreter’s body, Ian and Becky find out that Ian’s brother has been killed and framed for the murder. Jessica takes Milner from Dugtale’s to track down the phone she placed in Ian’s coat pocket, only for it actually to lead them to Arby, Grant and Carvel. Ian and Becky go to Dugdale’s for answers, but Wilson turns up and asks them where Milner is. Dugdale tells them about the phone Jessica planted in Ian’s coat, and remembering Grant is wearing it, him and Wilson go to track them down. Becky helps Dugdale rescue his wife and Alice. After Jessica finds Arby, Grant and Carvel, and struggles to get Carvel to reveal what has changed, Milner speaks to him and he reveals what he has done. The Janus ‘vaccine’ does not work except for Romani people, who he realised via statistics are the most peaceful people in the world, and should continue the Human race, leaving everyone else to die from Russian flu. Milner tells Carvel what he needs to do, to which he shoots Arby. Jessica then takes the injured Arby to safety. Grant and Wilson arrive, and ask Milner if she agrees with the change, she says she does not but understands it. She then calls up the man from the beginning of the episode and gives him his order. Wilson tells her to reverse it, but she does not. He threatens to kill Carvel, but Grant appears and shoots and kills Milner. Any hope of the order to be reversed are gone. The man from the fast food restaurant is abused by the same customer.
