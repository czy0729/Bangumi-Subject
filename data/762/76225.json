At the victim's apartment, a scan reveals the ingested poison to be Polonium-210, also known as \"The Terminator.\" Image captures from cameras show the woman who entered with the victim to be Irish national Nicole Ryan (Erin Richards). Hickman finds the fake Van Gogh painting. When a previous victim's veneer is traced to a warehouse, the team finds two of Ryan's cohorts. One of them mentions \"The Russian,\" a man who had Ryan poison her victims to see if the polonium worked. The other gives up Ryan's next target in Prague. Eva poses as a server at an art gallery. She has a geiger counter in her earpiece that alerts her when near Ryan. The team surrounds Ryan holding a glass of champagne. She reveals that her male victims seduced young women, and then she drinks the poison.

In Cannes, billionaire Lev Marianski's (Karel Roden) son, Maxim (Arthur Jacquin), is taken hostage, his security detail and girlfriend Laure (Fanny Krich) are shot and killed. Hickman and San learn of the case while visiting the police station. San remembers a similar case in Florence a few months prior. At the crime scene, Hickman suggests a professional hit — the shooting victims were double tapped and the killers left with Maxim in a hurry. Maxim's divorced parents arrive at the scene. Hickman notices Lev's nervousness and gets him to admit that a kidnapping insurance policy, which covers any ransom demands, was placed on his family. Lev also admits that Maxim had a tracer microchip implanted to get a discount on the policy. Berger traces the microchip to the local family villa. They find it, excised and bloody, sealed with a note mentioning future contact. The team sets up camp at the villa for any such contact. Vittoria is sent to Florence to check for connections between cases. Daniel gets a call from Dorn, asking why the team is investigating his contact regarding Dimitrov. Daniel realizes Lev is the contact, as the Marianksi financial records are being checked out and the abductors are Russian. Meanwhile, the kidnappers prepare Maxim for a video link to the parents and then call with their demands, €10 million in ten hours. Lev pleads for more time. The link is severed by an explosion at the villa.","status":"Air"},{"id":286332,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/286332","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Special Ops – Part 2","name_cn":"特战队 – Part 2","duration":"","airdate":"2013-07-21","comment":0,"desc":"The explosion was contained to the house's security room, but knocked out the power. The team meets outside with the parents. The kidnapper's liaison (Nadine Warmuth) monitors them from a nearby security camera and is told to call Lev Marianski. From the speaker of his phone, she mentions having everyone's attention. Hickman realizes they are being watched. The team uses the local police station as a hub. The kidnappers become distrustful of each other, yet enter the next stage of the plan by putting Maxim in an airtight container with a limited supply of oxygen running into it. In Florence, Eva meets with the only witness from the previous similar case, an art school's guidance counselor, Katya, who we know is the liaison. Katya cuts the meeting short and appears to be withholding information. Eva follows her to discover the video link between the kidnappers and the Marianskis. The two women fight and Katya is shot and killed. Louis gives the ransom money to a motorcyclist, while Tommy follows it in a helicopter. The team watches, via the video link that Eva keeps active, as the kidnappers prepare to set Maxim free. However, armed gunmen arrive and kill the kidnappers. Maxim remains locked away, his oxygen tanks depleting. After the cyclist is picked up but cannot help with details, Hickman questions Maxim's mother about the kidnapping. She confesses to it, out of hatred for Lev and overhearing Katya's previous plot, but doesn't know Maxim's location. Sebastian uses the IP address of the kidnappers' computer, along with images seen from the outside, to send Tommy to save Maxim just as he runs out of oxygen. Later at Hickman's trailer, Shari (Klára Issová) tells him that Genovese has left the area, but should return. They kiss.","status":"Air"},{"id":286333,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/286333","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"The Animals","name_cn":"野兽","duration":"00:42:32","airdate":"2013-07-28","comment":0,"desc":"Dorn asks Daniel if the Marianski kidnapping had anything to do with Dimitrov being his source.

Hickman is at The Hague's bank to ask the manager, Mr. Stoke, about an account with the passcode \"carnival.\" Hickman eyes some nervous customers and calls the office to request an open line. As he does this, a robbery ensues by people dressed in animal masks. They collect the hostages's cell phones, including Hickman's, which severs his line to the office. Then, the bank manager is strapped with a bomb and shoved out the front door. The bomb is detonated. Sebastian finds tunnels run all over the city from under the bank. The team realizes the robbery was a cover to stage a prison break using the tunnels. All involved are eventually captured. Daniel asks Hickman about some drugs found on him by the robbers. Hickman claims it is Lidocaine.

Sebastian and Tommy survey a Slovenia scene and deduce that someone was not being intentionally targeted. While one of Angela's captors, Paulo (Christian Burruano), is tended to in a hospital, his brother Antonio (Allan Cappelli Goetz) tells her about her father taking his family's land in order to manufacture drugs rather than olive trees. Nicola Conti (Duccio Camerini) was never criminally charged for it. He is arrested after his men, now intent on killing both Angela and Antonio, are tracked into some woods. Eva connects with Angela, as her own parents were killed for doing business with Nicola.

Hickman believes it to be his missing girlfriend, Shari, but it turns out to be the bank manager from earlier robbery. Hickman is arrested for beating her to death. His previous activity with the victim has been tracked, including an empty briefcase found behind his carnival trailer. The briefcase is thought to have contained €100,000 illegally taken from the bank. In the morgue, McConnel is allowed to look at the body. He says Hickman could not have beaten the victim with both hands, due to the injured right hand. An imprint from a ring with the monogram \"G\" was also found in some wounds. Daniel tells this to Hickman, who knows it belongs to Genovese (Kim Coates). Daniel also tells Hickman that he knew of Hickman's past with Genovese and asks him not to become a vigilante in the search for Shari. Hickman quits the team. He returns to the carnival and enters a funhouse. Inside, Genovese assaults him while admitting to killing the bank manager for stealing his money. He claims to have shot Shari in order to make it look like a murder-suicide and leaves Hickman handcuffed to her near the gun and a syringe. Meanwhile, Berger's computer and equipment has been hacked, for which he blames Vittoria's former employers. Dorn gets even closer to finding Dimitrov, but is ambushed.

Hickman gets into a gunfight with Genovese, ultimately wounding him. Both Shari and Genovese are taken to a hospital. Hickman apologizes to an unconscious Shari and goes to Genovese's room, where he tells Seeger and McConnel about Genovese using the traveling carnival for child trafficking. On the way back from Italy, where they are told San is missing, Berger and Vittoria are stopped by a roadblock. A burned car is pulled from a ditch. Vittoria believes it to be San's car and calls McConnel, when she can't reach Daniel. Berger wishes to have his equipment and Vittoria tells him of the deal she has been given — he can have his equipment fixed but his personal files will be released to the public. He agrees, if it helps find San. McConnel remembers an unidentified burned body in the morgue where the bank manager was. He and Hickman leave, while Seeger monitors Genovese. In Paris, after not finding Daniel nor his wife, Dorn gets a phone call to meet with Dimitrov (Marcel Iureş), who tells him Rebecca was the target of the bomb that killed the Daniels's son. She had helped send Dimitrov's brother-in-law to prison after the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis, where Dimitrov's wife and two daughters were killed. Dorn is given 24 hours to free the brother-in-law, if the Daniels are to be seen again. At the crash site, Berger's equipment reveals footprints heading away from the crash.
