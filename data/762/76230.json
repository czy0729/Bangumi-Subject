Later, Wendall wakes Daniel up and torments him while masturbating, revealing that he participated in Daniel's shower rape, though Daniel was unconscious at the time. While Daniel tries to shut Wendall out with a mantra, he is unable to and screams in anguish. Later he has covered up his window and refuses to leave his room. An extraction team is sent in to forcibly remove Daniel. In the present day, Daniel is comatose in an Atlanta hospital following his beating. Amantha and Judy sit at his bedside, and Amantha decides she wants a gun, then fantasizes about murdering the townsfolk of Paulie, starting with Judy Dean. Bobby Dean returns home to his mother, Judy, after beating Daniel. Judy appears happy to see him and offers him dinner. Sheriff Dagget insists on pursuing Daniel's attackers, despite the reluctance of his partner Lid Comphrey, and possible backlash from the Paulie community. The truck driven by the attackers is identified as belonging to Jake Johnson, a friend of Bobby Dean. Daggett interviews Johnson, implying he has more evidence than he actually does. Trey goes to a shed in his backyard, where he has stored George Melton's wallet, with his I.D., and the gun he used to kill himself. At the hospital, Amantha and Janet wait by Daniel's side. They are joined by Tawny, who wishes to see Daniel. Ted Jr. is reluctant to visit his stepbrother, using the excuse that he might create a hostile environment there. Ted Jr. has an awkward encounter with Tawny while scrutinizing his bruised neck from when Daniel assaulted him, as he lies about the cause of his neck injury and won't let Tawny examine it. He also insists on getting new coffee for the tire store. Amantha is visited at the hospital by Melvin, her landlord and a friend of Daniel, who offers Daniel a chocolate turtle. Janet insists that Ted Jr. visit Daniel, and he does so. When left alone with Daniel, Ted notices the mechanic figurine on a nearby table. He appears to brandish it while standing over Daniel. When Amantha arrives, Ted sets it down and she regards him with suspicion. The comatose Daniel has a dream in which he brings Kerwin to the pecan grove, where the statue has lost its head. Daniel expresses reluctance to return to the real world, which is full of pain and suffering. Kerwin tells Daniel it's his choice, but says he loves him either way before departing cheerfully.","status":"Air"},{"id":286380,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/286380","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Sleeping Giants","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:19","airdate":"2014-06-26","comment":0,"desc":"Back on Death Row, Daniel receives a letter outlining the expected good behavior of inmates. This enrages him and he tears his room apart, throwing his books and bedsheets around, which entertains Wendall. In the present, the doctor decides it is time to wake Daniel up from his coma. Amantha holds onto her pessimism, while Janet tries to be optimistic. Ted, Jr. has several ideas on how to make more money off the struggling tire shop, such as affordable rentals. Ted Sr., however, rejects these ideas, holding onto the tradition of the tire store. Ted Jr. spends more time at the tire store, supposedly working, and dismisses Tawny when she visits him. Later Tawny confesses to Ted Jr. that his suspicions regarding her and Daniel were justified, as Daniel had romantic feelings for her. Tawny also confesses that she had feelings for Daniel as well. Ted Jr. is upset by this, but does not lash out, expressing his disappointment but saying he appreciates her telling the truth. He then leaves. Jon Stern visits Hollis, a client who is on death row and has failed an appeal after lying about his DNA, tarnishing Jon's perfect record for appeals. Jon agrees to share Hollis' last meal, as Hollis has no one else. Trey visits George Melton's father, asking about George but leaving his true intentions murky. Bobby Dean is drinking his sorrows, apparently out of guilt over Daniel's beating. Jake Johnson and another accomplice confront Bobby outside a bar, chastising him for showing his face to Daniel. Bobby insists he won't rat on Jake. When Bobby drunkenly points out the alliteration in one of Jake's turns of phrase, Jake punches him, threatening him with death if he doesn't \"get his head right\". Sheriff Daggett wants to interview a young boy named Stevie who was an eyewitness to Daniel's beating. He convinces Stevie's mother to let him speak to him, and Stevie positively identifies Bobby Dean. In another Death Row flashback, Daniel returns to his cell, which has been stripped of all accommodations, and tries to sleep on the bare metal slab of his bed. Wendall continues to torment Daniel, shouting at him to wake up. This prompts him to wake up from his coma in the present, where he is greeted by his mother. At the same time that Janet and a tearful Amantha welcome Daniel back, Daggett arrests Bobby Dean at his home, while a distressed Judy Dean watches. At home, Ted Jr. is in the bathroom when Tawny gets the call that Daniel has woken up. She tells Ted Jr. through the door. He is unresponsive, and shown to be sitting fully clothed on top of the toilet seat. Ted Jr. flushes the toilet.","status":"Air"},{"id":286381,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/286381","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Charlie Darwin","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:07","airdate":"2014-07-03","comment":0,"desc":"Daniel, just returning home after his hospital stay, is wiping windows when he sees a branch fall from a tree across the street. Amantha approaches him, telling him he doesn't have to clean the windows, but Daniel insists he wants to. He then expresses a desire for apple fritter. As Amantha goes to the bakery to get pastries, the proprietor recognizes her, voices her support for Daniel, and mentions that Bobby Dean has been arrested. Shocked, Amantha returns home to tell her mother. Shortly afterward, Sheriff Daggett comes by to question Daniel. When Daggett asks Daniel if the man who removed his mask was Bobby Dean, Daniel insists it was a stranger. Daggett is frustrated by this, as are Amantha and Janet. They argue about it in the kitchen. Daniel insists that arresting Bobby Dean would be pointless. Jared overhears, and leaves the house on his bicycle. Daniel attempts to help his neighbor lift the fallen branch on his property, but the strain clearly takes a toll on Daniel's injured body. Ted comes by, sees Daniel and tries to ignore him, but the neighbor greets him, forcing them to acknowledge one another. Ted Jr. still wants to set up a rim rental in the tire shop, and is trying to get Janet to sign the contract, as the store is under her name. However, she quickly dismisses Ted before he can tell her about it. Ted's only chance is to put up his own house as collateral. Tawney is reluctant to sign this contract, angering the already cold and passive-aggressive Ted. Eventually she relents and signs it. Daggett visits Bobby Dean in his cell, and asks him what he plans to do with his life after prison. Bobby Dean is evasive. Daggett then releases him, implying that in some cultures Bobby would be indebted to Daniel for letting him go free. Bobby Dean says \"not this culture\" and leaves. Daniel goes for a drive in his mother's car.","status":"Air"},{"id":286382,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/286382","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Donald the Normal","name_cn":"","duration":"00:44:29","airdate":"2014-07-10","comment":0,"desc":"Amantha has second thoughts about moving to Atlanta. To motivate herself to stay in Paulie, she gets a job as a cashier at a strip mall thrift store. Ted Jr., still feeling hurt by Tawney's confession of her feelings for Daniel, visits Daggett and recounts the coffee grounds incident, though he refuses to press charges. Daniel visits Kerwin's family in Atlanta, where he enjoys his anonymity, speaking with a group of middle aged women at an art gallery and calling himself \"Donald\". However, this experience is tarnished when a couple in a cafe recognize him and ask for an autograph. When Daniel refuses, they grow angry, claiming the \"wrong man was set free\". Daniel returns home and, finding his mother's house empty, immediately sets about tearing the kitchen apart in a misguided effort to begin work on the planned remodel.","status":"Air"},{"id":286383,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/286383","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Act as If","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:58","airdate":"2014-07-17","comment":0,"desc":"Ted Sr. starts to lose patience with Daniel after the latter destroyed the kitchen.

There, Lezlie ties himself to Daniel to make sure they stay together the whole time, offers Daniel cocaine and they shoot at clay pigeons, though Daniel is reluctant to handle a shotgun.
