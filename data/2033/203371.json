The bittersweet biography centers on a deaf Parisian taxidermist, blending humor and tragedy to create a powerful meditation on love and life. Ernie Biscuit is narrated by Elliot’s long-time collaborator John Flaus. \r\n　　Ernie Biscuit will have its world premiere at the Sydney Film Festival in June, followed by a European premiere at the Annecy International Animation Festival a couple weeks later.
