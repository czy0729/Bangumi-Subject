A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you!\r\n\r\n• Dive Into a Vast Underwater World\r\nYou have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful.\r\n\r\n• Scavenge, Craft, and Survive\r\nAfter crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items.\r\n\r\n• Construct Underwater Habitats\r\nBuild bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean.\r\n\r\n• Unravel the Mystery\r\nWhat happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive?\r\n\r\n• Disrupt the Food Chain\r\nThe ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators.\r\n\r\n• Handle the Pressure\r\nBuild a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more.\r\n\r\n• Fear the Night\r\nAs the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see.\r\n\r\n• Dive Below the Ocean Floor\r\nCave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.\r\n\r\n• Open Development\r\nGet weekly or daily updates, see what the development team is working on, view real time change logs, and give feedback from inside the game. Subnautica Early Access development is open, and the development team wants to hear from you.\r\n\r\n• About the Development Team\r\nSubnautica is being created by Unknown Worlds, a small studio founded by Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire that traces its roots back to the 2003 Half-Life mod Natural Selection. The team is scattered around the globe, from the United States to the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Russia, Thailand, Australia, and many more places. There is a central office in San Francisco, California that serves as home base for the whole team.\r\n\r\n• Warning\r\nThis game contains flashing lights that may make it unsuitable for people with photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitive conditions. Player discretion is advised.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>深海迷航</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/48558\">Unknown Worlds Entertainment</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/48558\">Unknown Worlds Entertainment</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>美丽水世界</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS5</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox Series X/S</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AAVG</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unity</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2018年1月23日(PC)</li><li><span>售价: </span>¥99.00</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">售价: </span>$29.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/</li><li><span>其他发行日期: </span>2018年12月4日(PS4, Xbox One)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">其他发行日期: </span>2021年5月14日(NS, PS5, Series X/S)</li><li><span>抢先体验发行日期: </span>2014年12月16日(Steam)</li>","collection":{"on_hold":27,"dropped":13,"wish":57,"collect":152,"doing":12},"tags":[{"name":"生存","count":36},{"name":"PC","count":30},{"name":"沙盒","count":30},{"name":"STEAM","count":19},{"name":"恐怖","count":18},{"name":"AVG","count":11},{"name":"2018","count":8},{"name":"PS4","count":5},{"name":"全成就","count":5},{"name":"神作","count":4},{"name":"2018年","count":4},{"name":"PS5","count":3},{"name":"探索","count":2},{"name":"XGP","count":1},{"name":"2018前","count":1},{"name":"不满20小时","count":1},{"name":"XSX","count":1},{"name":"2021","count":1},{"name":"九星","count":1},{"name":"3A","count":1},{"name":"重口","count":1},{"name":"白金","count":1},{"name":"猎奇","count":1},{"name":"美国","count":1},{"name":"AAVG","count":1},{"name":"","count":""}],"staff":[{"id":48558,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/2e/7a/48558_prsn_xUS99.jpg","name":"Unknown Worlds Entertainment","desc":"发行"},{"id":48558,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/2e/7a/48558_prsn_xUS99.jpg","name":"Unknown Worlds Entertainment","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":297293,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e8/76/297293_5qfx2.jpg","title":"Subnautica: Below Zero","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/297293"}],"like":[{"id":126797,"name":"小小梦魇","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c7/8d/126797_cXdTD.jpg"},{"id":264147,"name":"奥伯拉丁号归来","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4d/52/264147_4nvBH.jpg"},{"id":249317,"name":"毁灭战士 永恒","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/21/cf/249317_LOS2l.jpg"},{"id":126841,"name":"漫漫长夜","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a7/83/126841_CGCZc.jpg"},{"id":121307,"name":"在世界尽头咏唱恋曲的少女YU-NO 重制版","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/17/d3/121307_iP3bt.jpg"},{"id":155364,"name":"如龙 极","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e7/2d/155364_cV6TK.jpg"},{"id":308541,"name":"漫威蜘蛛侠：迈尔斯·墨拉莱斯","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/82/34/308541_jXp20.jpg"},{"id":221638,"name":"勇者斗恶龙 创世小玩家2 破坏神席德与空荡岛","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/8b/a3/221638_GmfOw.jpg"}]}
