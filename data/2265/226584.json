All men who stay at this inn immediately fall in love with me...\" Elisa\r\n\r\nOur visual novel introduces the story of Elisa, a beautiful owner of an inn, struggling with the amorous proposal of honorable Knights, high born Princes and rich Merchants.\r\nIt will be the Player to decide Elisa's fate and his/her choices may even influence her destiny for the better or the worse.\r\n\r\nThe Player is -not- the protagonist of this story, however.\r\nHis/Her judgements affect every character and their actions, like a god that watches everything from above. For this reason, every decision is a tough choice to make.\r\nYour choice will change the story forever!\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Prequel summarizes about 20% of our complete story and features 3 main story branches.\r\nThe choices you make take account for the possibility of gaining special items; It's up to you to dicover them and when to use them.\r\nThis allows you to influence the outcome of the story in a positive or negative way in specific situations, deciding how the story unfolds.\r\n\r\nOf course all of those features will play a much more important role once our story will be available in the future.\r\n\r\nThe Prequel is just our first step!\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it!","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Visual Novel</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>Single-player</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2016-06-15</li><li><span>售价: </span>Free</li><li><span>开发: </span>Neoclassic Games</li>","collection":{"wish":1},"tags":[{"name":"STEAM","count":1},{"name":"GAL","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":221835,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ac/f9/221835_FwZzv.jpg","title":"Elisa: The Innkeeper","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/221835"}]}
