It is loosely based on the 1987 arcade game Bionic Commando. In the game, the player has to explore each stage and obtain the necessary equipment to progress. The protagonist is Ladd Spencer, a commando equipped with a bionic arm featuring a grappling gun, allowing the protagonist to pull himself forward or swing from the ceiling. As such, the series is one of few instances of a platform game in which the player cannot jump. To cross gaps or climb ledges, the hero must use his bionic arm.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>生化尖兵</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Bionic Commando (NES)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>希魔复活</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>希特勒复活</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GB</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1988年7月20日</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":9,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"FC","count":5},{"name":"ACT","count":4},{"name":"视频通关","count":1},{"name":"Capcom","count":1},{"name":"Platform","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":56870,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b6/5b/56870_6Njk9.jpg","title":"Bionic Commando (2009 video game)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/56870"},{"id":56863,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/33/b5/56863_YCCaI.jpg","title":"Bionic Commando Rearmed","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/56863"}]}
