It was published by Enix and developed by Quintet (クインテット) and Ancient for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.\r\nAs its Japanese name implies, Robotrek was intended as a humorous game. Designed to appeal to a younger audience, Robotrek's main focus is on allowing the player to raise up to three robots which are built from spare parts that may be found, gained through battles, or generated by the player by means of the game's item combination system. Next Generation describes it as a predecessor to the core idea of Pokémon in the sense that the protagonist does not himself fight, but sends out his robots to do so. Like Pokémon, each robot was kept in a ball.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>勇者机器人</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/10646\">QUINTET</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/988\">エニックス</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>SLAPSTICK</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Robotrek</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年7月8日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":10646,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/c0/04/10646_prsn_Q577J.jpg","name":"QUINTET","desc":"开发"},{"id":988,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/99/08/988_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"艾尼克斯","desc":"发行"}]}
