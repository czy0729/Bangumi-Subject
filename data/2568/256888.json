Both versions have essentially the same engine with a different story and theme. They also have a strict time limit that punishes tardiness with lost lives.\r\nThe player takes control of Ruka-chan, an aggressive demon girl who lives in a world filled with harmful monsters. Much of her past is shrouded in mystery and her age is deliberately hidden in context. She lives a long life but has the mentality of a 13-year-old girl. Compared to the futuristic setting of The Jetsons, the Japanese version uses a contemporary setting with Japanese architecture. Extra features were added into the Japanese version including an extra underwater level, a mini-game, and a training mode.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>露卡大冒险</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/9162\">スティング</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/518\">角川書店</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Yōkai Buster: Ruka no Daibōken</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Youkai Buster: Ruka no Daibouken</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995年6月9日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":9162,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5c/af/9162_prsn_een11.jpg","name":"STING","desc":"开发"},{"id":518,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5a/52/518_prsn_ZwMWM.jpg","name":"角川书店","desc":"发行"}]}
