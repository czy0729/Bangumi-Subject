The player, as the eponymous ninja, must rescue the daughter of a local lord by fighting his way through hordes of masked bandits led by a mysterious warlord. A second player can join in as Sasuke's monk friend Chin-nan.\r\nThe game has a distinct sense of speed and verticality, and it's recommended that the player(s) try running and jumping around performing aerial attacks rather than staying on the ground and getting quickly swarmed by enemies.\r\nThe game was published by SunSoft and developed by an unknown developer, though Mint is thought to have contributed to its sound design. A US SNES localization, with the title Boy Ninja Sasuke, was briefly considered but then axed.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>忍者小子</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17913\">Sunsoft</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>忍者少年</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>少年忍者佐助</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Shounen Ninja Sasuke</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AAVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年10月28日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"BeatUp","count":1},{"name":"AAVG","count":1},{"name":"SFC","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":17913,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/3c/00/17913_prsn_tGoT3.jpg","name":"Sunsoft","desc":"发行"}]}
