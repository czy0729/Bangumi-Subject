My mind finds little that could be called erotic, but much that is visually sensuous. In part, that is due to his painting techniques here, as many of the individual images are strongly crackled or impastoed and apparently photographed still wet, so that the paint glistens in the changing light. Additionally, the rate of image change is much slower than usual with him. Rather than the expected 12-24 images per second, here we see 2 or 3 per second and have more time to enjoy the abstract shapes and the rotation of rich colors through the palette. Should some numerically-oriented person ever decide to count the total of individual paintings done by Brakhage in his hundreds of short films, I think we'll find that Picasso was not the most prolific painter of the 20th century after all. \"Lovesong\" forms a striking and satisfying conclusion to the \"By Brakhage\" collection.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>爱之歌</li><li><span>导演: </span><a href=\"/person/32239\" rel=\"v:directedBy\">Stan Brakhage</a></li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2001-03-04</li><li><span>片长: </span>11分钟</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>无对白</li>","collection":{"wish":4,"collect":7,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"冷门","count":1},{"name":"2001","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":32239,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/24/fa/32239_prsn_DHHxo.jpg","name":"斯坦·布拉哈格","desc":"导演"}]}
