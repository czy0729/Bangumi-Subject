Like one pulling the other's ears forward, tying them in front of his face, getting a big rock in between the tied ears and pulling said ears with rock toward the face making a big fluffy hole on it. Or using grass seed with water on other's face, growing grass on it, and using a lawnmower to mow it down! Or painting red marks on it so it looks like a baseball before hitting it, then another face appears literally from the neck up! Like I said, pretty bizarre and highly recommend! I saw this on Volume 5 of The International Tournee of Animation from 1992. Well worth seeing if you like the offbeat.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>不信弄不哭你</li><li><span>导演: </span><a href=\"/person/20643\" rel=\"v:directedBy\">Bill Plympton</a></li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1991</li><li><span>片长: </span>6min</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Maureen McElheron / Bill Plympton</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":10,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":4},{"name":"1991","count":3},{"name":"比尔·普莱姆顿","count":1},{"name":"Bill.Plympton","count":1},{"name":"非日本","count":1},{"name":"BillPlympton","count":1},{"name":"美国","count":1},{"name":"搞笑","count":1},{"name":"动画短片","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":20643,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b4/07/20643_prsn_AZRzO.jpg","name":"比尔·普莱姆顿","desc":"导演"}]}
