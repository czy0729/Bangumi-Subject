This short, using simple cut-out animation, and the song \"Three--- Blind--- Mice----\" tells of horrific factory accidents that befell three mice that work there. \"They didn't check their machinary....those three blind mice....\" is how some of the lyrics go. A bizarre party film.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>三只盲鼠</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1945</li><li><span>片长: </span>4:37</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>加拿大</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>导演: </span>George Dunning</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":5,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"其它","count":1},{"name":"短片","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":914709,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/914709","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
