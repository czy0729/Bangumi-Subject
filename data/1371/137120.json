But our man has a plan: use the dragons to produce power! And so a new utilities is born, Consolidated Dragon! But the dragons are a non-renewable source of energy. Soon, black-outs are inevitable. And those environmentalists who want to save the dragons! This is not good for Consolidated Dragon's profitability. Oh! but they forgot about wind power! Great way to look at our society and its materialistic way of life. Made in 1978 but still of its time.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>喷火龙</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1978</li><li><span>片长: </span>9:17</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>加拿大</li><li><span>导演: </span>Brad Caslor / Christopher Hinton</li>","collection":{"collect":6,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"1978","count":3},{"name":"短片","count":2},{"name":"欧美","count":1}]}
