The basic plot question is poses is: which is preferable, a beautiful gilded cage, or your freedom? \r\n　　The director is of Indian (as in south Asian) heritage, and it shows. Paradise looks a lot like the Taj Mahal. This short was done with a combination of computer and cell animation, and is quite pretty to look at. The vivid colors associated with India and the tropics are the predominant palettes used in this film. \r\n　　This is a more attractive film to look at than, say, \"Balance\", which won the same Oscar in the early 90's. However, the moral from \"Balance\" has stayed in my head since I saw it years ago. I'm not sure that the same will be true for this film.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>仙境</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>别名: </span>{Paradis</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2004-01-21</li><li><span>片长: </span>15分钟</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>加拿大</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>导演: </span>Ishu Patel</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Ishu Patel (conception)</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":891073,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/891073","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
