Similarly to Tropico 5, there are four eras: The Colonial era, the World Wars era, the Cold War era, and the modern era. Unlike previous games in the series, where Tropico consisted of only one island, Tropico 6 allows players to build on an archipelago of smaller islands, allowing players to build bridges (in the World Wars era and later) from their starting island to the other islands in the chain.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>海岛大亨6</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SIM</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unreal Engine 4</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019年3月29日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Limbic Entertainment</li><li><span>发行: </span>Kalypso Media</li>","collection":{"wish":6,"collect":14,"doing":2,"on_hold":2,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":5},{"name":"2019年","count":2},{"name":"HaemimontGames","count":2},{"name":"PS4","count":2},{"name":"XBOX","count":2},{"name":"SIM","count":2},{"name":"ONE","count":1},{"name":"Haemimont","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":107635,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/73/26/107635_SK6JH.jpg","title":"Tropico 5","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/107635"}]}
