There, Marnie discovers that Desi has been addicted to Oxycontin for a year, resulting in a violent argument. After shutting Desi out of the house, Hannah gently explains to Marnie that she didn't notice Desi's addiction because she spends too much time thinking about herself; something that Hannah admits she understands all too well. She reaffirms their friendship, and eventually helps her take Desi home. Meanwhile, Elijah agrees to accompany Shoshanna to a networking event organised by two former college friends of Shosh's, who started their own clothing line.

The two engage in a long debate about Chuck's shortcomings in his interactions towards women (as he appears unaware of the impact of the power imbalance between him and the college girls Hannah quoted) and Hannah's journalistic mistake (since most of her sources for the article were Tumblr blog posts, and therefore relied on hearsay. Eventually, they begin to bond over their shared literary preferences, and their perceived insecurities. However, after Hannah apologizes for writing the article, Chuck manipulates her into grabbing his penis, and Hannah finally understands who he really is.

After a fight with her daughter at a laundromat while high, Loreen disappears. After hours of looking, Elijah and Hannah find her at a Chinese restaurant. There, Loreen breaks the news of Hannah's pregnancy to Elijah, who does not take it well, and bluntly tells Hannah she would be a terrible mother. Meanwhile, a grieving Ray is going through Hermie's apartment with an obviously disinterested Marnie. Finally fed up with her self-absorbed behaviour, Ray tells her he wants to break up.

Adam starts pestering Hannah to watch the first cut of his film, saying he wants her to confirm its accuracy, and when he won't stop bothering her, she shocks him by revealing her pregnancy. Subsequent to this, Jessa turns up at Hannah's apartment and confronts her for not telling her herself. Despite Hannah making clear that she wants nothing to do with her, Jessa tells her that she cannot just erase everything that they went through.

On his way out, Elijah is surprised by the arrival of his former boyfriend, Dill Harcourt - who is trying to hide from some paparazzi due to a recent scandal involving him trying to adopt on the black market. Hannah agrees to keep an eye on him while Elijah leaves. At the audition, Elijah initially tries to bail, but then meets a young woman named Athena, who persuades him to stay, and the two bond. Elijah's audition initially goes well, although it soon emerges he has no control over the basketball he has been given. Meanwhile, upon learning of Hannah's dilemma with her baby, Dill firmly tells her that not having a father figure when he grew up was the reason he couldn't bring himself to love anybody. She then takes Paul-Louis' call, and finally tells him of his baby. Although he is genuinely surprised, and offers some support, he admits he is not ready to be a father. After the call, Hannah breaks into tears, and an also-crying Dill comforts her. Elijah returns from the audition to find the two bonding over television and pizza, and after initially standing up to Dill, Elijah invites him to his room for sex. The next morning, he receives a phone call from the producers, offering him a part - on the condition he is kept well away from the ball. Concurrently, Marnie is broke, and has just received an eviction notice. Unable to get support from her mother, other than a place to sleep, she goes to pawn some of her jewellery, only to discover that all of the seemingly precious jewellery that her parents gave her was fake. When this revelation causes her to throw a narcissism-laced tantrum, the appraiser rolls his eyes at her, and tells her that she is merely trying to blame other people for her predicament; the only liar in her life is herself. Deeply affected by this encounter, and realising that she needs to take responsibility for her life, Marnie leaves a message on Desi's voicemail expressing regret at the way she treated him throughout their marriage.","status":"Air"},{"id":699313,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/699313","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"What Will We Do This Time About Adam?","name_cn":"","duration":"00:29:35","airdate":"2017-04-02","comment":0,"desc":"Having given in to his nostalgia, Adam decides to ask Hannah if he can help her raise the baby.

She is struggling with motherhood, getting stressed that Grover will not breastfeed, and her relationship with Marnie is fractious. Eventually, Marnie calls Loreen for help. This only enrages Hannah further and after a particularly angry fight, she storms off, leaving Grover in Loreen and Marnie's care. While she's gone, Loreen advises Marnie that she should not put her love for Hannah above her own happiness, as she herself had lost her own \"best friend,\" (Tad) by making the same mistake. Hannah, meanwhile, encounters a visibly destressed teenage girl running from a house in a state of undress. Thinking she was running away from a rapist, Hannah offers her support and her trousers. Upon discovering the girl is actually just a bratty teen running away from home because her mother ordered her to do her homework, Hannah angrily berates her, in turn coming to her own understanding about motherhood. The girl runs off, leaving Hannah to walk home pantsless, although a concerned police officer insists on escorting her there. She arrives to find Loreen and Marnie sitting on the porch, Grover asleep upstairs. They make space for her, and give her a glass of wine, the three finally at peace for the night. Grover's crying emerges on the baby monitor, and Hannah goes to soothe him.
