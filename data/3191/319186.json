Play single-player, or explore forgotten ruins with a friend in two-player co-op*. Take on an expansive world with complete freedom—bound up cliffs, glide across chasms, and fly through the slipstream with velocity. Detonate explosives, harness electricity, and wield high tech weapons to overcome a malevolent army of robotic invaders.\r\n\r\nEach week, the Stormland reveals new challenges set among never before seen peaks, ruins, strongholds, and caves nestled in an expansive cloudscape. Find new tech, build yourself up, and discover just how far you can push past the limits of your design.\r\n\r\nReclaim your world.\r\n\r\n*Internet required for co-op.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>风暴之地</li><li><span>平台: </span>Oculus Rift</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Oculus Rift S</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>动作、冒险、探索</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人/多人合作</li><li><span>开发: </span>Insomniac Games</li><li><span>发行: </span>Oculus Studios</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019年11月15日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$39.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://insomniac.games/game/stormland/</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"VR","count":1}]}
