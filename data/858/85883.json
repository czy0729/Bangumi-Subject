Mary Stuart, the 15-year-old headstrong Scottish heiress to the throne of the Kingdom of France, leaves the convent where she has been staying since age nine to begin her tumultuous rise to power. With the assistance of her four loyal handmaidens, Greer, Kenna, Lola and Aylee, Mary has been sent to secure Scotland’s strategic alliance by formalizing her arranged engagement to the French king's dashing son, Prince Francis. But the match isn’t signed and sealed, for it depends more on politics, religion and secret agendas than affairs of the heart. Prince Francis is intrigued by the fiery Mary, but like most young men, he resists the idea of settling down into marriage, especially when he has a history with a lady of the court and his own point of view on the wisdom of an alliance with Scotland. Further complicating things is Bash, Francis’ handsome, rogue half-brother, who has a history of his own. Though he is all too aware that Francis is the heir to the throne and Mary’s intended husband, Bash soon develops his own feelings for Mary. Meanwhile, Francis' mother, Queen Catherine, is aware of Mary’s inflammatory effect on her son and his half-brother, just as she is aware of the extramarital dalliances of her husband, King Henry, not only with his mistress, but with other ladies of the Court. Queen Catherine turns to her trusted adviser, the seer Nostradamus, who terrifies the Queen with his prophecy that marriage to Mary will cost Francis his life. Catherine is determined to save her son, no matter how many others have to pay with their lives. Also, Mary soon realizes that unseen foes within the castle are conspiring to sabotage her marriage to Francis and even threaten her life.","status":"Air"},{"id":331989,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/331989","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Snakes in the Garden","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-10-24","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":331990,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/331990","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Kissed","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-10-31","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":331991,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/331991","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Hearts and Minds","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-11-07","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":331992,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/331992","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"A Chill in the Air","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-11-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":331993,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/331993","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Chosen","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-11-21","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":331994,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/331994","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Left Behind","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-11-28","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":331995,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/331995","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Fated","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-12-05","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":331996,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/331996","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"For King and Country","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-12-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":331997,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/331997","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Sacrifice","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-12-19","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":331998,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/331998","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Inquisition","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-12-26","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":331999,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/331999","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Royal Blood","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-01-02","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":332000,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/332000","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"The Consummation","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-01-09","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":393750,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/393750","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"Dirty Laundry","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":393751,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/393751","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"The Darkness","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":393752,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/393752","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"Monsters","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":393753,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/393753","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-04-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":393754,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/393754","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-04-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":181343,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/59/d1/181343_Rt67B.jpg","title":"Reign Season 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/181343"}]}
