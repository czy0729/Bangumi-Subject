Against swarms of vicious, demonic avatars, your only defenses are the gems you conjure that, when placed atop towers or into traps and amplifiers, become conduits for powerful magical and elemental attacks. GemCraft combines fast-paced real-time strategy as you deal with waves of incoming monsters, and cunning tactics that allow you to craft and combine magical gems. \r\n\r\nCreate traps that poison or slow, discover powerful artifacts and unlock new abilities, and stand alone against The Forgotten, a seemingly unkillable archdemon whose endless armies threaten to swallow the world. GemCraft is packed with multiple levels of difficulty, hundreds of achievements, nearly two hundred levels, and much, much more, making it a rewarding, deep strategy game you'll come back to over and over again.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>宝石争霸 暗影追击</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>塔防</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Flash</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2015年4月30日</li><li><span>售价: </span>¥ 36</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://store.steampowered.com/app/296490/GemCraft__Chasing_Shadows/</li><li><span>开放商: </span>Game in a Bottle</li><li><span>发行: </span>Armor Games</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":4,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"TD","count":2},{"name":"塔防","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":310717,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/24/0c/310717_kpwGh.jpg","title":"GemCraft - Frostborn Wrath","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/310717"}]}
