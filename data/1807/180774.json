Richard meets with a company called Flutterbeam that wants to hire him as CTO. However, disappointed at how banal the project assigned to him would be, he rejects the offer and decides to stay with Pied Piper. Afterwards, Richard meets with Jack Barker, Raviga's choice for the CEO of Pied Piper. Meanwhile, at Hooli, Belson discovers that the now invalid employment contracts would allow him to fire affected employees without severance and take back unvested stock options. Belson fires the entire Nucleus team, and uses the profits from the reclaimed stock options to offer Big Head a $20 million severance package in exchange for non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements.","status":"Air"},{"id":632886,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/632886","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Two in the Box","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-05-01","comment":1,"desc":"Richard meets with the sales team at Pied Piper. During the meeting, Richard finds out the plans for platform are business-facing, instead of consumer-facing. Referring to his experience of the Dot-com bubble, Jack explains to Richard that they need to make profit fast, and promises that he would never compromise the product, explaining later that by \"product\" he means in fact the company's stock value. Richard tells the sales team what he wants the platform to be, but they want to remove every feature that Richard wants, so it's easier to sell it to businesses. Later, the sales team show Richard a commercial for the product, and it's exactly what Richard does not want it to be. Meanwhile, Jared plans to move back into his condo, but the tenant refuses to leave or pay rent; as Erlich explains how difficult it is to evict a tenant, Jian-Yang decides not to accept the end of his own lease. At Hooli, Gavin suggests to the engineers to alter the company's search algorithm so it doesn't display any more negative Nucleus stories about him or his company.

Further appalled by this prospect, Richard continues to push his idea of Pied Piper as a platform versus the box appliance, but Jack refuses. Upon learning this, Gilfoyle quits and begins to receive several job offers and gifts from recruiters. In an attempt to have Jack's decision reverted, Richard meets with Laurie who turns out to agree with Richard's vision that Pied Piper should be a platform. However, Laurie's influence is limited as firing a recently appointed senior CEO would make the company look bad. In one of his job interviews Gilfoyle finds himself at Endframe, now employing two of the coders from Hooli, and Gilfoyle learns that they have cracked Richard's middle-out algorithm. Gilfoyle reports back to his old team at Pied Piper and they decide on what they call a Skunkworks project: to secretly pursue the original vision for Pied Piper alongside working on the box appliance, seemingly complying with Jack's order. Jared refers to Meinertzhagen's Haversack, cautioning everyone to act inconspicuously, and to destroy all traces of their conspiracy. However, upon entering their office space the next morning, Richard trips, and incriminating documents which he had meant to shred are spread all over the floor and brought to Jack's attention.","status":"Air"},{"id":632888,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/632888","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Maleant Data Systems Solutions","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":3,"desc":"After he caught the team red-handed trying to develop the platform in secret, Jack threatens to fire them. Richard fires back, stating that without him and his team he won't be able to deliver a working prototype of the box to Maleant before the planned deadline. The team agrees with Jack to create a basic functioning box to meet the requirements of the deal, after which they are free to create the platform. However, due to the team's inability to deliver a lesser product on purpose, the final box ends up being far better than anything else available in the market. Meanwhile, Erlich keeps trying to rent rooms in his incubator. After a prospective tenant rejects his house in favor of another one, Erlich finds out that he moved to a 9 bedroom mansion which belongs to Big Head, who is hosting tenants for free in return of a share of their startups. Initially, he confronts him and leaves in a rage, but when his car doesn't start, he turns back and proposes a partnership, to which an oblivious Big Head agrees. In a board meeting at Pied Piper to vote for Maleant's box deal, Monica notices that the sales agreement includes exclusive rights to use Pied Piper's algorithm for 5 years, which would effectively prevent Richard from creating the platform during that period. Jack admits he never specified a time frame when he made a deal with Richard. He also adds that neither he nor Laurie can do anything about it. Even though Laurie notices Jack's low blow, she stands with him as she doesn't have proof that Richard's platform can be more valuable than the box deal. Monica ends up voting against it, alongside Richard and Erlich, effectively denying the motion, even if it means her job and board seat. Later that night, Gavin Belson phones Richard, triumphantly informing him that he just acquired Endframe's middle out compression platform for $250 million. Unbeknownst to him, by doing this he also set a price point on Pied Piper's platform, valuing it way above (and thus terminating) the box deal, rendering a new vote useless and saving Monica's position. When the team returns to the office the next day, they find out Laurie fired Jack for undermining her at the meeting. She leaves the CEO position open, and gives them permission to start working on the platform.","status":"Air"},{"id":632889,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/632889","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"The Empty Chair","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":5,"desc":"The team finds out Pied Piper is running out of money, as Raviga is funding them in installments and will only continue to do so when they deliver the finished product, which is now the platform. They take drastic measures and decide to get rid of the office, its equipment and all employees, returning to Erlich's incubator. Meanwhile, Erlich drafts a manipulative partnership agreement with Big Head which gives Erlich complete control over Big Head's assets, even if his Pied Piper shares aren't included in it. Richard confronts Laurie about an article on a tech blog called Code/Rag which mocks Pied Piper's absence of a CEO and Richard himself. Laurie agrees that he should meet with its author, C. J. Cantwell, in order to restore their reputation, but demands that he speaks with their head of PR first. When Richard gets to Raviga to do so, he enters the wrong room and ends up ranting about Laurie's actions in front of Cantwell, mistaking her for the head of PR. At the same time, Laurie confides to Monica that she was wrong to remove Richard as CEO in the first place, but that he shouldn't be perceived as the first choice but rather the correct one, thus her search for lesser prospective candidates (including Big Head). Laurie planned to award Richard the position at the next board meeting, as long as he remained professional. When Richard realizes he's been talking to Cantwell all along, he tries to prevent her from publishing the story. She tells him she will only back away if he feeds her something better. Erlich and Big Head meet at the incubator to sign their partnership deal, as Erlich announces its name: \"Bachmanity\". Upon hearing of Richard's predicament, Big Head lets slip that Gavin Belson secretly ordered his employees to scrub all negative publicity about Hooli from the internet. Richard immediately seeks Cantwell to publish this story instead of his and ends up finally being repromoted to CEO. Meanwhile, the team reveals that they hired an engineering team composed of outsourced coders working remotely from various places around the globe, at a fraction of the cost of hiring them in Palo Alto.","status":"Air"},{"id":632890,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/632890","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Bachmanity Insanity","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":6,"desc":"Gavin Belson faces public backlash from the story published by Cantwell.

Meanwhile, Erlich sets up an expensive Hawaiian-themed party at Alcatraz to launch Bachmanity while Big Head warns him that he can lose all his severance money if Belson finds out he shared the story with Cantwell, which constitutes a breach of his non-disclosure agreement. Erlich dismisses him and says he'll fix it. Richard starts dating Winnie, a coder for Facebook, and eventually brings her home. The following morning, Gilfoyle and Dinesh notice that Winnie uses spaces instead of tabs for coding, a technique which, they tell her, Richard despises. When she reveals this to him, Richard tries to deny it as an issue, but the relationship eventually goes sour because of his inability to deal with it. Meanwhile, Big Head's business manager, Arthur Clayman, warns him that he has to control spending or risk going bankrupt. At the same time, Erlich phones Big Head, announcing that he acquired Code/Rag, Cantwell's blog, for $500,000, thus buying her into not revealing her source, to Clayman's shock. Dinesh flirts via video chat with Elizabet, one of Pied Piper's outsourced coders who lives in Estonia, but when he finally reveals himself she mentions her \"boyfriend\", while Gilfoyle mocks him. During the party, which Erlich dubbed \"Bachmanity Insanity\", Sasha, the party manager, tells Bachman that the supplier's checks have bounced. Right before the big speech, Clayman informs him that Bachmanity has gone broke.","status":"Air"},{"id":632891,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/632891","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"To Build a Better Beta","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":1,"desc":"Erlich and Big Head's venture firm, Bachmanity, is unable to pay its debtors following its million dollar luau. While bankruptcy looms over their partnership, Pied Piper anticipates an early launch following good rapport from their selective beta launch. One of the selected early users of the beta is revealed to be a Hooli spy after Gilfoyle reveals adding a God view to the beta app allowing them access to users IP to their pinpoint geographic location. Erlich and Big Head discover that Big Head's former business manager has misappropriated $6 million which is needed to pay the million-dollar Alcatraz party bills. Erlich and Big Head threaten legal action via consultation with a district attorney, but Bachmanity's cause is a low priority for the justice department. Erlich ultimately is able to pay the Alcatraz party bills by selling some of his Pied Piper shares to Laurie. At Hooli, Gavin gets paranoid after learning Pied Piper has discovered the illegally downloaded beta app and shuts down the power to Hooli. The principal (recently re-hired) developers of Nucleus resign, leaving the Hooli rebuild of Nucleus in a hiatus state. Erlich has a private meeting with Laurie about his shares in Pied Piper.

At Hooli, the board of directors inform Gavin Belson that they are discharging him from his position due to the failure of the investment Endframe, confirming at the same time that they are allowing the Pied Piper app to enter the Hooli App Store.

Richard calls Monica aside and reveals to her that the number of daily active users is actually very poor, something that only he and Jared know. Realizing that the beta version of the platform was only a success because they only showed it to fellow engineers and tech-savvy users, Richard proposes introducing a series of seminars and tutorials about how to use the platform, which, ironically, is too advanced for regular users. Confronted with this, all of Pied Piper's recently employed staff quits, including Douglas, a customer service rep, who heads for an interview at Hooli. Sensing an opportunity, Gavin Belson interviews him personally and learns about Pied Piper's low number of DAU's. Later, he summons the board to announce that his intention was never to develop a platform, introducing Hooli Endframe's new director, Jack Barker, and their new product: a box just like the one Barker had planned for Pied Piper. The board gets Belson reinstated as CEO. Facing Pied Piper's apparent downfall, Richard tells Jared that he will dissolve the company. The following morning, however, the number of daily active users has risen sharply, which unbeknownst to the whole team (including Richard) is only so because Jared has paid for a click farm in Bangladesh to provide daily active users to the platform.","status":"Air"},{"id":632894,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/632894","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"The Uptick","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":1,"desc":"An elephant that Gavin Belson used to make a point at a board meeting dies at Hooli Campus.

Richard finds out about Jared's clickfarm operation with Dinesh and Gilfoyle telling him they know about it as well and producing software to make clickfarm operation undetectable, thus backing it up. Oblivious to all of this, Erlich reveals that he managed to gather buzz over Pied Piper throughout the valley and attract a significant investment from Coleman Blair Partners, a venture capital firm. Jared encourages Richard not to sign the deal, as he will be effectively legitimizing fraud. When pressed to sign, Richard reveals the truth to Erlich and the Coleman Blair board, terminating the deal. Erlich gets furious, as the whole valley will now know that Pied Piper has faked its numbers, stripping it of all interest to investors. Laurie pulls away and puts the platform up for sale to the highest bidder. Anxious to get revenge on Richard, Gavin Belson offers $1 million to buy it and effectively extinguish the company. He also buys Code/Rag for $2 million in order to prevent the elephant story from spreading to the public. Monica, having been fired from Raviga for opposing Laurie, joins the team, which ultimately realizes that their video chat app, a side project by Dinesh, is considerably better than Hooli's.
