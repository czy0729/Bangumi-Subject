It is Free and Open Source Software released under the LGPL.\r\n\r\nMinetest is a sandbox building game, inspired somewhat by Infiniminer but mostly by Minecraft, created by Perttu \"celeron55\" Ahola. The gameplay is very similar to Minecraft's, consisting of creating and destroying blocks in a local or online 3D environment.\r\n\r\nMinetest is Free and Open Source Software, released under the LGPL. It was done this way to be more readily available to Linux users, and so that random people (like you!) could fix bugs and experiment effectively.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>sandbox</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人/多人</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://minetest.net/</li>","collection":{"collect":4},"tags":[{"name":"C++","count":1},{"name":"自由软件","count":1},{"name":"开源","count":1},{"name":"高自由度","count":1},{"name":"沙盒","count":1},{"name":"像素","count":1}]}
