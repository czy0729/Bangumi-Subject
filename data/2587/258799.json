An American port, called Brigandine: The Legend of Forsena, was released in the same year by Atlus. In 2000, Hearty Robin released a remake of the game called Brigandine: Grand Edition, which included multiplayer support, along other new features. In the game, the player chooses one of the nations of the fictional continent of Forsena, and has the goal of conquering the other nations by taking their castles, using troops composed by human commanders and fictional creatures. Although primarily a turn-based strategy game, the game includes some characteristics of tactical role-playing games.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>幻想大陆战记</li><li><span>别名: </span>Brigandine</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Brigandine: The Legend of Forsena</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>ブリガンダイン グランドエディション</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>幻想大陆战记加强版</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Brigandine: Grand Edition</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SLG, SRPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1998年4月2日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Hearty Robin</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"relations":[{"id":290176,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/86/8f/290176_wfmY3.jpg","title":"ブリガンダイン ルーナジア戦記","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/290176"}]}
