The game was released as a spin-off to Square's Final Fantasy series of video games. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was first released in North America in 1992 and marketed as a \"simplified role-playing game... designed for the entry-level player\" in an attempt to broaden the genre's appeal. The game's presentation and battle system is broadly similar to that of the main series, but it differed in its inclusion of action-adventure game elements. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was the first Final Fantasy game to be released in Europe.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>最终幻想：神秘历险</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/18338\">スクウェア</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/18338\">スクウェア</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Mystic Quest Legend</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>ファイナルファンタジーUSA ミスティッククエスト</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>FINAL FANTASY USA MYSTIC QUEST</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年10月5日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":18338,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/78/8c/18338_prsn_8zeCe.jpg","name":"史克威尔","desc":"开发"}]}
