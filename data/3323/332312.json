The backdrop to Sorn's life tale is the story of Thailand's classical music from its golden age during the reign of King Rama V to near extinction after the end of the absolute monarchy when the government banned it as uncivilised in the 1930s -- a time when Field Marshall Plaek Pibulsongkram tried to push the Kingdom into the modern era. The film shifts back and forth from the time when Sorn was a young man, playing in a xylophone duel with the intense Kun In, to the 1940s, when Thailand was under Japanese occupation and Sorn's playing would provide some inspiration to the oppressed citizenry of the time. （来源：IMDb）","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>最后的木琴师</li><li><span>别名: </span>The Overture</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Hom Rong</li><li><span>集数: </span>1</li><li><span>开始: </span>2004-02-06(泰国)</li><li><span>类型: </span>真人电影</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>泰国</li><li><span>语言: </span>泰语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>1h43min</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0415046</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"eps":[{"id":1020026,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1020026","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"lock":"条目已锁定"}
