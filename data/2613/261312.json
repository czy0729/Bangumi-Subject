B shoots (hold for rapidfire). A sends out a strong magic attack. C chooses a weapon. Powerups and magic attacks are found in treasure chests opened by shooting at them.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>光辉传说</li><li><span>别名: </span>闪耀传说</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Twinkle Tale</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>TwinkleTale</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG (Top-down)</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年7月24日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Zap</li><li><span>发行: </span>Toyo Records</li>"}
