The playable characters from the original were left to just one (only Lena), the magic system was replaced by special weapons, and the animated sequences from the original version also were removed. Though several levels were removed, a new level (Castle Vanity is actually based on the second half of the first stage from the original Valis IV) was designed for this version.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超级梦幻战士4</li><li><span>别名: </span>スーパーヴァリス 赤き月の乙女</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Super Valis IV</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年3月27日</li><li><span>开发: </span>レーザーソフト</li><li><span>发行: </span>レーザーソフト</li>"}
