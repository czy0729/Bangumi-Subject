Alpha Beam was compatible with the Atari Kid's Controller, which was sold separately, although the regular keyboard controller is also compatible.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span>Children's Computer Workshop、<a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1983年9月</li><li><span>程序: </span>Michael Callahan, Preston Stuart</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
