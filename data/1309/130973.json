With this uncertainty, Bachman and Hendricks pitch Pied Piper to numerous venture capitalists who are trying to woo them. They find that being rude leads to better reception, to Bachman's surprise. Meanwhile, Raviga's partners select Laurie Bream as their new managing partner, whose eccentricity resembles Peter Gregory's. Monica learns that Pied Piper is the firm's only hope for survival. The firms deliver their term sheets and just as Bachman selects a firm, Bream and Monica arrive to deliver Raviga's term sheet – $20 million at a $100 million valuation, the highest. They are about to accept it when Monica sneaks by after hours to warn Hendricks against taking a high amount, saying that if the company cannot increase their valuation, they will not be able to secure further funding. At Peter Gregory's funeral, Bream approaches Hendricks and asks if he has made a decision. Hendricks says that he will choose Raviga if they lower their term sheet to $10 million at a $50 million valuation, a move Bream is surprised by but accepts. The funeral is attended by many, including the founders of Snapchat and Gavin Belson. As Belson speaks about his relationship with Gregory, Hendricks receives a message informing him that Hooli is suing Pied Piper for intellectual property theft."},{"id":516344,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/516344","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Runaway Devaluation","duration":"","airdate":"2015-04-19","comment":3,"desc":"After learning of Hooli's lawsuit, Laurie Bream decides that Pied Piper is too big of a risk and decides to drop the company from Raviga Capital's portfolio. Bachman and Hendricks meet with the other venture capitalists and are informed that due to the lawsuit, along with their behavior at the previous meetings, they are no longer interested in Pied Piper. Meanwhile, Dinesh meets with his cousin Wajeed who is crowdfunding an app called Bro, which is similar to Yo but instead sends the word \"bro\". After hosting a crowdfunding party and a $500 donation from Gilfoyle meant to irritate Dinesh, Wajeed meets his goal of $50,000. Jared finds a venture capitalist on the Bro app, but when they meet it turns out to be a \"brain rape\" scam to steal their algorithm, causing Bachman and Jared to quickly end the presentation. With no options left but to hire a \"cheap\" lawyer for $2.5 million, Gavin Belson calls Hendricks and asks to meet him privately. At a bar, Belson proposes Hooli acquiring Pied Piper and bringing Hendricks back into the Hooli team. Belson says that on the path he is on right now, Hendricks is forming the exact type of \"soulless\" corporation he despises.

On the way to meeting with Gavin Belson, he is stopped by Russ Hanneman, a flashy billionaire who made his money by putting radio on the internet (a parody of Mark Cuban). Hanneman takes Richard to an expensive restaurant and offers him $5 million for equity in Pied Piper and two seats on its board. Monica tells Richard that Hooli is by far the safer option and that Hanneman is a terrible person, but Richard ignores her. Monica informs Bream of his decision, and Bream expresses disgust at the idea of being associated with Hanneman. With the knowledge that they are funded, Pied Piper begins creating a budget for the next 18 months, and negotiating how many new people they will hire. During the budget meeting, Hanneman visits Pied Piper and disrupts it by talking loudly on the phone and hanging out with his friend Cory. Erlich tries to befriend Hanneman but fails. Hanneman tells Pied Piper that revenue is a bad thing, explains that the check he gave them is just a \"show check\", and buys several Pied Piper billboards without asking. Meanwhile, Belson compares the treatment of billionaires to the suffering of Jews in the Holocaust during an interview, manages the backlash, and gets his lawyers to figure out how to improve his case for suing Pied Piper."},{"id":516346,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/516346","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"The Lady","duration":"","airdate":"2015-05-03","comment":2,"desc":"Pied Piper begins interviewing new people to hire. The two most notable candidates are Jared Patakian, an eccentric man who labels himself as a cyborg, and Carla Walton, a friend of Dinesh and Gilfoyle. With the introduction of Jared Patakian, Jared Dunn is renamed \"Other Jared\", which is often shortened to \"OJ\". Other Jared hires Carla, awkwardly tries to explain that it's better to hire her because she's a woman, and tries to enforce company human resources policies. Erlich discourages Richard from hiring Jared Patakian because he chose a different job just as Erlich was about to hire him at Aviato, and Carla tortures Gilfoyle and Dinesh by making them think she makes way more money than them. Additionally, Pied Piper has a meeting of the Board of Directors at Hanneman's house. Hanneman gives his girlfriend a seat on the board, and Erlich turns against Richard to vote to order $30,000 worth of merchandise. Later, Richard decides to hire Jared despite Erlich's disapproval, but quickly finds out that Patakian has done the exact same thing to him as Patakian did to Erlich. Simultaneously, Belson promotes Big Head to be Co-head Dreamer on the Hooli XYZ project with the intention of making him seem like the primary force behind Pied Piper, and thus evidence for his lawsuit. Big Head is given a massive office and an assistant, but suspiciously no responsibilities, while Davis Bannercheck, a pioneer of robotics, is named the other Co-head Dreamer and leads operations at the lab."},{"id":516347,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/516347","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Server Space","duration":"","airdate":"2015-05-10","comment":3,"desc":"Richard is suffering from night sweats, and is told by his doctor if his stress level remains high he will begin bedwetting. Richard begins searching for office space, thus separating work and life and accommodating for growth. The team tours an office neighboring a modeling agency, leading Dinesh to suggest leasing it. Meanwhile, Gavin Belson is more concerned with grudges than innovation at Hooli XYZ, blatantly ignoring Bannercheck's concerns about Big Head's progress. Bannercheck resigns and Big Head becomes the sole Head Dreamer of Hooli XYZ. Richards asks the team to begin setting up servers, and they learn all of the major hosting providers have blacklisted Pied Piper due to Hooli threatening to cease business with them. Gilfoyle mentions that the providers would eventually be unable to meet their needs and suggests building the servers himself. The parts can be purchased if the team does not lease the office, so team agrees to stay in the house. The delivery truck for the parts draws suspicions from their neighbor Noah, who is adamant about the neighborhood only being for families and pets and threatens to turn them in to the City Inspector – especially after a mistake by Dinesh temporarily cuts power to the neighborhood.

The demo fails miserably. Pied Piper sees this as an opportunity to show off their technology by partnering with \"Homicide\" energy drink, owned by a former classmate of Erlich's, and broadcasting a publicity stunt. Dinesh and Gilfoyle notice that Blaine, the stunt driver, has miscalculated his ramp speed and will likely be killed attempting the stunt. Blaine arrogantly refuses to listen to their concerns. Gavin Belson, caught short by the Nucleus failure, worries that he has surrounded himself with sycophants who only tell him what he wants to hear. Gilfoyle and Dinesh debate the morality of letting Blaine kill himself performing the stunt. Later, Blaine comes in to apologize and sees the SWOT analysis they performed for it posted on the wall, becoming highly offended. Richard discovers that Homicide has omitted the Pied Piper logo from the broadcast and the partnership with Homicide falls apart, and Richard agrees to broadcast a live stream of a condor egg as a technology demo instead. At the end of the episode the Homicide stunt is broadcast along with End Frame's logo.

The meeting ends with Gavin realizing that he may need a scapegoat. In the next scene, he convinces Davis Bannercheck to return to Hooli to head up the Nucleus project. Richard learns that Seth Lee, the network security engineer for End Frame had been fired, presumably due to Gilfoyle's breaching of End Frame security in episode 7. Richard feels bad and reaches out to Seth. Richard tells Seth that the break-in had not been his fault. Seth becomes enraged and threatens to hack into Pied Piper and get revenge. Richard becomes very concerned about Seth's threats. Gilfoyle is unconcerned, assuring Richard that Pied Piper's security is solid. Dinesh stresses that Richard should not be admitting to anybody that Pied Piper had broken into End Frame, explaining that Richard is now a \"black hat\" and needs to be careful. Bannercheck interviews the Nucleus team to assess the state of the project. In the next scene, Gavin learns that Bannercheck has quit Hooli and left as fast as his car would take him. Gavin realizes that he has lost his scapegoat for the upcoming Nucleus fiasco. Richard's increasing paranoia about Seth annoys the Pied Piper team. Richard reaches out to Seth again and they mutually apologize. Richard tells Seth that Gilfoyle hadn't been worried at all and Seth feels insulted and issues fresh threats. Pied Piper begins transferring data from Intersite for the bake-off. Russ Hanneman arrives to celebrate and Richard becomes angry at the interruption and begins shouting at Hanneman. Suddenly Pied Piper receives a frantic phone call from the CTO of Intersite informing them that Pied Piper is deleting all of Intersite's data. In the ensuing panic, they conclude that Seth has made good on his threats and has hacked into their system although Gilfoyle can't figure out how.

It is revealed that all of Pied Piper's new developers quit and Richard has low hopes for the company's survival. After negotiations, aided by their lawyers, Belson agrees to drop the lawsuit in favor of binding arbitration to prevent the press from finding out about the phone. Ron suggests disbarred lawyer Pete Monahan to represent them, who is willing to work on spec because he is no longer allowed to practice law in a real court due to suspected sex crimes. During discovery, Monahan discovers that Richard had used a Hooli computer to run a single test of Pied Piper while his personal laptop was being repaired, which is referred to as his \"girlfriend\". Per the terms of Richard's employment contract, that would mean that Hooli owns the rights to Pied Piper. At the arbitration, Hooli's lawyers don't appear to have a real case, and instead try to build up Big Head as the modest genius who actually invented Pied Piper. However, an unintentional slip by Bachman leads Hooli to realize that the \"girlfriend\" that Richard said in his emails that he had \"dropped off at the Apple store\" was actually his laptop, meaning that he must've used a Hooli computer. Hooli calls Richard as a witness and, unwilling to lie under oath, Richard admits that he used a Hooli computer.

Despite numerous setbacks, including a server catching on fire, they are able to keep the feed online until the technician is rescued. Erlich starts to question the value of the incubator and considers selling the house, but changes his mind when he finds out that it would be torn down. Erlich codes for the first time in the series, helping the team with emergency improvements while Richard is away. At the binding arbitration, the judge rules that per Richard's employment contract Hooli would own Pied Piper's intellectual property, and Richard sends a text to the team to delete all of the Pied Piper code before Hooli can seize it. However, the judge continues that Hooli's claim is actually nullified by an illegal non-compete clause and Richard, whose phone runs out of battery, has to sprint back to the incubator to stop Pied Piper from being deleted. Richard arrives just after the deletion program is run but the program crashes before any damage is done. Word spreads at Hooli of the verdict, which renders over half of their employees' contracts invalid. Word also spreads of Big Head's series of promotions, leading Denpok to begin mentoring him.
