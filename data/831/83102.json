It utilizes a single-input system, with punch mapped to the A button, kick to the B button, and the left and right triggers used for tagging and throws, respectively. The game also included a side-step feature that made the game have a 3D feel similar to Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, which was released later the same year.\r\nDespite the simplification, Tekken Advance introduces new mechanics by implementing a wide range of \"stun\" variations such as \"pop stuns\", \"crumple stuns\" and right/left stuns.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>铁拳A</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Tekken Advance</li><li><span>平台: </span>GBA</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2001年12月21日</li>","collection":{"collect":6},"tags":[{"name":"GBA","count":4},{"name":"铁拳","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":1598,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9c/19/1598_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"南梦宫","desc":"开发"}]}
