Written by Anna Christopher and directed by Ishi Rudell and Katrina Hadley, it is the fifth one-hour Equestria Girls special, following 2018's Forgotten Friendship and Rollercoaster of Friendship, and 2019's Spring Breakdown and Sunset's Backstage Pass. It is the last piece of Equestria Girls content produced by DHX Media (now known as WildBrain).\r\n\r\nThe special premiered on Discovery Family on November 2, 2019. Unlike previous specials, Holidays Unwrapped is a compilation of six seven-minute shorts instead of a single hour-long story.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>小马国女孩 节日合辑特别篇 (2019)</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2019-11-02</li>","collection":{"collect":4,"on_hold":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":2},{"name":"EQG","count":1},{"name":"MyLittlePony","count":1},{"name":"Hasbro","count":1},{"name":"My_Little_Pony","count":1},{"name":"MLP","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":967372,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/967372","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
