Joining the ride is Clara, (Doc's wife from Back To The Future Part III,) Jules and Verne (their sons) Einstein the dog and Jennifer (Marty's girlfriend). And apparently there's a Tannen in every time as relatives of Biff keep popping up, and creating conflict. Mary Steenburgen and Tom Wilson reprise their roles from the movies. During live portions of the show, Christopher Lloyd reprised his role as Doc Brown and was joined by Bill Nye, who conducted experiments that were used in the show.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>回到未来 第二季</li><li><span>话数: </span>13</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>1992年9月19日</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>RTL Television</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>1992年12月26日</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":2,"doing":1,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"无","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":488262,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/488262","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Mac the Black","name_cn":"","duration":"30m","airdate":"1992-9-19","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":488263,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/488263","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Put on Your Thinking Caps, Kids!
