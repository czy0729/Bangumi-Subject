The show aimed to find the next top fashion model. The cycle's catch-phrase was, \"They are all gorgeous, but only one has what it takes\".\r\n\r\nThe prizes for this cycle were a contract with IMG Models, a fashion spread and a cover in Jane magazine, and a cosmetics campaign with Sephora.\r\n\r\nThis was the only season to feature a cast of 12 contestants. The international destination for the cycle was Milan, Italy.\r\n\r\nThe winner was 23-year-old Yoanna House from Jacksonville, Florida.\r\n\r\nThis was also the first appearance of Nigel Barker as a judge.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>全美超模大赛 第二季</li><li><span>别名: </span>America's Next Top Model Season 2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>全美超级模特新秀大赛 第二季</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>全美超模 第二季</li><li><span>集数: </span>11</li><li><span>开始: </span>2004-01-13</li><li><span>结束: </span>2004-03-23</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>United States</li><li><span>电视网: </span>UPN</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>www.cwtv.com/shows/americas-next-top-model</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0511484</li><li><span>主演: </span>Tyra Banks / Janice Dickinson / Nigel Barker / Eric Nicholson / Yoanna House / Mercedes Scelba-Shorte / Shandi Sullivan / April Wilkner / Camille McDonald / Sara Racey-Tabrizi / Catie Anderson / Xiomara Frans / Jenascia Chakos / Heather Blumberg / Bethany Harrison / Anna Bradfield</li>","eps":[{"id":752259,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/752259","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"The Girl Who Overslept","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2004-01-13","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":752260,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/752260","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"The Girl Who Has A Temper","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2004-01-20","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":752261,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/752261","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"The Girl Who Can Cry At The Drop Of A Hat","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2004-01-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":752262,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/752262","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"The Girl Who Needs Six Months Of Modeling School","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2004-02-03","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":752263,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/752263","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"The Girl Who Is A Visual Orgasm","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2004-02-10","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":752264,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/752264","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"The Girl Whose Lip Puffed Up","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2004-02-17","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":752265,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/752265","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"The Girl Who Is Dripping With Hypocrisy","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2004-02-24","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":752266,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/752266","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"The Girls Who Go To Milan","name_cn":"","duration":"2004-03-02","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":752267,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/752267","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"The Girl Who Is Afraid Of Snakes","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2004-03-09","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":752268,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/752268","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"The Girl Who Cheated","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2004-03-16","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":752269,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/752269","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"The Girl Who Is America's Next Top Model","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2004-03-23","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":226855,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/22/4d/226855_Mr4me.jpg","title":"America's Next Top Model (cycle 1)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/226855"},{"id":226863,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/dd/6b/226863_RkcKb.jpg","title":"America's Next Top Model (cycle 3)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/226863"}]}
