The film is the third of the Generation 3 My Little Pony films and the second film to promote the Crystal Princess line. Unlike The Princess Promenade, the film has been criticized. The DVD also features two more animated feature, Greetings from Unicornia and Friends are Never Far Away, which was originally released on video in 2005.\r\n\r\nThe Runaway Rainbow was made available on hubworld.com (a successor of Hasbro's MonkeyBarTV website), alongside My Little Pony: A Very Minty Christmas and My Little Pony: The Princess Promenade. But they were removed from the site later. The movie is been reissued in the 2-disc DVD collection My Little Pony: Classic Movie Collection, alongside The Princess Promenade, Dancing in the Clouds and Friends are Never Far Away.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>我的小马之水晶公主：消失的彩虹</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>别名: </span>彩虹小马：逃跑的彩虹</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>我的小马驹：逃跑的彩虹</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2006-9-12</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0893497</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":4,"dropped":4},"tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":1},{"name":"美国","count":1},{"name":"原创","count":1},{"name":"OVA","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":489883,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489883","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":126728,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d6/7f/126728_u03Ym.jpg","title":"My Little Pony: A Very Minty Christmas","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126728"},{"id":126729,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/27/f2/126729_g2sPb.jpg","title":"My Little Pony: The Princess Promenade","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126729"},{"id":126731,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0a/36/126731_3UwzU.jpg","title":"My Little Pony: A Very Pony Place","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126731"},{"id":126732,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/db/20/126732_Fe4Lj.jpg","title":"My Little Pony: Twinkle Wish Adventure","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126732"},{"id":29870,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4d/61/29870_l5RTL.jpg","title":"My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic : S1","type":"不同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/29870"}]}
