The film is the second of the Generation 3 My Little Pony films and the first film to promote the Crystal Princess line. It featured the debut of the Breezies and the 2006 re-design of Spike the dragon, who originally featured in the first My Little Pony series from the 1980s.\r\n\r\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics, and became the first successful My Little Pony animation to date, before the debut of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. It has a strong following amongst G3 collectors[citation needed], and has been positively received by many since its DVD debut in 2006. The DVD also features two bonus episodes: A Charming Birthday, which was originally released on video in 2003 and Pinkie Pie and the Ladybug Jamboree. The film is notable for being the MLP animation that was sent to Lauren Faust in the hopes of retooling the My Little Pony series.\r\n\r\nThe movie has been reissued in the 2-disc DVD collection My Little Pony: Classic Movie Collection, alongside The Runaway Rainbow, Dancing in the Clouds and Friends are Never Far Away.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>我的小马：公主大道</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>别名: </span>小精灵马：公主兜风</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>彩虹小马：公主大道</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2006-2-7</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0490668</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":4,"dropped":4},"tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":1},{"name":"美国","count":1},{"name":"原创","count":1},{"name":"OVA","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":489882,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489882","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":126730,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/85/c2/126730_cC86D.jpg","title":"My Little Pony Crystal Princess: The Runaway Rainbow","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126730"}]}
