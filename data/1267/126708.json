The first half of the season is included within the Volume Three DVD box set, which was released on April 15, 2008, and the second half is included within the Volume Four DVD box set, which was released on April 28, 2009. The fourth season consisted of one 2AJNxx holdover episodes while the remaining episodes of the season were from 3AJNxx production line.\r\n\r\nBecause of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, there was a shortage of episodes this season. Much like Family Guy, the episodes that were shown during the WGA strike did so without permission from Seth MacFarlane, since MacFarlane showed support for the writers by not finishing any planned episodes until the strike ended.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>特工老爹 第四季</li><li><span>话数: </span>16</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2007年9月30日</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>星期一</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>TBS</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2008年5月18日</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":3,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":1},{"name":"美国","count":1},{"name":"原创","count":1},{"name":"TV","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":489620,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489620","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"The Vacation Goo","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2007-09-30","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489621,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489621","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Meter Made","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2007-10-07","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489622,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489622","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Dope & Faith","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2007-10-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489623,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489623","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Big Trouble in Little Langley","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2007-11-04","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489624,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489624","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Haylias","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2007-11-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489625,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489625","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"The 42-Year-Old Virgin","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2007-11-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489626,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489626","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Surro-Gate","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2007-12-02","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489627,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489627","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"The Most Adequate Christmas Ever","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2007-12-16","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489628,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489628","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Frannie 911","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2008-01-06","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489629,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489629","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Tearjerker","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2008-01-13","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489630,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489630","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Oedipal Panties","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2008-01-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489631,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489631","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Widowmaker","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2008-02-17","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489632,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489632","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"Red October Sky","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2008-04-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489633,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489633","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"Office Spaceman","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2008-05-04","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489634,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489634","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"Stanny Slickers II: The Legend of Ollie's Gold","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2008-05-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489635,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489635","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"Spring Breakup","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2008-05-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":126707,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c5/a0/126707_aRmqT.jpg","title":"American Dad!
