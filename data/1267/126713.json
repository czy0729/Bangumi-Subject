To compensate for this, they aired the episode \"National Treasure 4: Baby Franny: She's Doing Well: The Hole Story\" early. \"Minstrel Krampus\" has since been rescheduled for the following season.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>特工老爹 第九季</li><li><span>话数: </span>19</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2012年9月30日</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>星期一</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>TBS</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2013年5月12日</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":4,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":1},{"name":"美国","count":1},{"name":"原创","count":1},{"name":"TV","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":489713,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489713","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Love, AD Style","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2012-09-30","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489714,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489714","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Killer Vacation","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2012-10-07","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489715,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489715","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Can I Be Frank With You?","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2012-11-04","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489716,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489716","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"American Stepdad","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2012-11-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489717,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489717","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Why Can't We Be Friends?","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2012-12-02","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489718,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489718","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Adventures In Hayleysitting","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2012-12-09","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489719,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489719","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"National Treasure 4: Baby Franny: She's Doing Well: The Hole Story","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2012-12-23","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489720,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489720","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Finger Lenting Good","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2013-01-06","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489721,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489721","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"The Adventures of Twill Ongenbone and His Boy Jabari","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2013-01-13","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489722,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489722","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Blood Crieth Unto Heaven","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2013-01-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489723,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489723","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Max Jets","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2013-02-10","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489724,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489724","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Naked to the Limit, One More Time","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2013-02-17","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489725,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489725","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"For Black Eyes Only","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2013-03-10","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489726,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489726","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"Spelling Bee My Baby","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2013-03-24","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489727,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489727","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"The Missing Kink","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2013-04-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489728,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489728","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"The Boring Identity","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2013-04-21","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489729,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489729","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2013-04-28","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489730,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489730","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"Lost in Space","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2013-05-05","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":489731,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/489731","type":0,"sort":19,"name":"Da Flippity Flop","name_cn":"","duration":"22m","airdate":"2013-05-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":126712,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/dc/94/126712_2nnD8.jpg","title":"American Dad!
