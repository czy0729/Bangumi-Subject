Several episodes (notably \"Five Votes Down\" and \"Mr. Willis of Ohio\") feature the White House desperately digging for a backdoor through which to pass a particular piece of legislation. This powerlessness ends in \"Let Bartlet Be Bartlet\" when Leo and the president finally agree to fight any battle they believe to be important, even if they are not sure they can win. The season ends with a cliffhanger assassination attempt with an ominous call over a Secret Service radio: \"Who's been hit?! Who's been hit?!\"","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>白宫风云 第一季</li><li><span>别名: </span>白宫群英 第一季</li><li><span>集数: </span>22</li><li><span>开始: </span>September 22, 1999</li><li><span>结束: </span>May 17, 2000</li><li><span>类型: </span>Political drama</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>United States</li><li><span>每集长: </span>42 minutes</li><li><span>电视台: </span>NBC</li><li><span>首播国家: </span>United States</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Aaron Sorkin,Lawrence O'Donnell Jr.,Patrick Caddell,Paul Redford,Ron Osborn,Jeff Reno,Dee Dee Myers ,Rick Cleveland</li><li><span>主演: </span>Rob Lowe, Moira Kelly, Dulé Hill, Allison Janney, Richard Schiff, John Spencer, Bradley Whitford and Martin Sheen</li><li><span>作曲: </span>W.G.
