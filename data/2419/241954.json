Items are strewn across the landscape in the form of \"E\" letters, which give players bonus points or power-ups the ship's weapons. Aside from aerial enemy patterns and ground tanks and turrets, the player also has to deal with obstacles in the form of square structures which appear when the player gets close and are indestructible.\r\n\r\nOne unique feature from HAL 21 is the bosses, which are composed of multiple small parts. Whenever the player hits a boss part, it flies off from the boss's body before reattaching.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1985年</li>","collection":{"collect":2,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARC","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}]}
