A total of nine episodes were planned with only the first one released. Developed by Ritual Entertainment and powered by the Source game engine, the first episode \"Emergence\" was the first computer game by a major developer to both be produced episodically and delivered over the Internet without the intervention of a publisher. This was accomplished through Valve Corporation's Steam content delivery system.\r\nIn 2007, Ritual was acquired by casual game developers MumboJumbo, stalling the franchise and leaving the future of the series uncertain. With the sale of Ritual to MumboJumbo and departure of several employees, all future development of Sin Episodes appears to be delayed indefinitely, if not entirely canceled.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>原罪前传：浮现</li><li><span>别名: </span>原罪外传：浮现</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Source</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2006年5月10日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"FPS","count":1}]}
