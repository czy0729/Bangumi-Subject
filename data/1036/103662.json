It featured the biggest cast change in the show's 9-year run, with many characters from the first three series departing and many new characters introduced to replace them. Most notably, the series saw the introduction of the Maguire family as main characters rather than the antagonists that they were in the early series. From series 4, the Maguire's would gradually become the focus of the show during its final years. Alongside Tina Malone (Mimi Maguire), Sean Glider (Paddy Maguire) and Samantha Siddle (Mandy Maguire), new members of the Maguire family were introduced. Firstly, Ciaran Griffiths took on the role of the homosexual yet homophobic Mickey Maguire. Aaron McCusker joined the cast as murderer Jamie Maguire, the oldest Maguire child who had been in prison for 10 years, whilst Nicky Evans, who appeared in a guest role in series 3, returned on a regular basis as \"runt of the litter\" Shane Maguire. All of the Gallagher family returned, and Annabelle Aspion reprised her role of absentee mother Monica, which led to the exit of Maggie O'Neill as Sheila Jackson. Also returning from previous series was Dystin Johnson as Monica's lesbian lover Norma Starkey, who also became a regular cast member. With the introduction of Aaron McCusker as her new love interest, Rebecca Atkinson, who has played Karen Jackson since the first series, became a more prominent character, having been a recurring character during the second and third series. The Chatsworth police became a regular in the series with Michael Legge and Amanda Ryan portraying young police officers Tom and Carrie, alongside original cast member Warren Donnelly (Stan Waterman)","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>无耻之徒(英版) 第四季</li><li><span>集数: </span>8</li><li><span>开始: </span>2007-01-09</li><li><span>结束: </span>2007-02-27</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>频道: </span>Channel 4</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"eps":[{"id":399697,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/399697","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":399698,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/399698","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":399699,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/399699","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":399700,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/399700","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":399701,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/399701","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":399702,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/399702","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":399703,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/399703","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":399704,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/399704","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":103661,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d4/2d/103661_BSpKQ.jpg","title":"Shameless(UK) (Season 3)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/103661"},{"id":105268,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f4/b2/105268_6u636.jpg","title":"Shameless(UK) (Season 5)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/105268"}]}
