It's their getaway, their refuge. Rosie's friend Windy is always there, too, like the little sister she never had. But this summer is different. Rose's mom and dad won't stop fighting, and when Rose and Windy seek a distraction from the drama, they find themselves with a whole new set of problems. One of the local teens - just a couple of years older than Rose and Windy - is caught up in something bad... Something life threatening.\r\n\r\nIt's a summer of secrets, and sorrow, and growing up, and it's a good thing Rose and Windy have each other.\r\n\r\nThis One Summer is a tremendously exciting new teen graphic novel from two creators with true literary clout. Cousins Mariko and Jillian Tamaki, the team behind Skim, have collaborated on this gorgeous, heartbreaking, and ultimately hopeful story about a girl on the cusp of childhood - a story of renewal and revelation.\r\n","info":"<li><span>出版社: </span>First Second</li><li><span>价格: </span>$17.99</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2014-05-06</li><li><span>页数: </span>320</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>159643774X</li><li><span>作者: </span>Mariko Tamaki</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":4},"tags":[{"name":"漫画","count":3},{"name":"欧美","count":2},{"name":"玉城吉莉安","count":1},{"name":"2014","count":1},{"name":"玉城真理子","count":1}]}
