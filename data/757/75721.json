Forge runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, etc... \r\n\r\nThis is very different than playing solitare Magic with Apprentice or Magic Workstation because the AI will attack and play spells. Currently there are over 10,000 cards ranging from old power cards like Ancestral Recall and Lightning Bolt and newer cards like planeswalkers. The user interface is basic, but it does let you download all of the cards pictures and view them while playing the game.\r\n\r\n(If you don't know how to play Magic: The Gathering download this windows demo or from here. Also checkout the YouTube videos at http://playmagic.com. The main website for Magic: The Gathering is dailymtg.com)\r\n\r\nYou can also play sealed deck, draft, or the new quest mode. In draft mode the AI drafts for the 7 other opponents and builds the decks from the cards that it chooses. In the quest mode you start out with a few cards and the more games that you play the more that you win. As you get more cards you can update and change your deck.\r\n","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>集换式卡牌游戏</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":3,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"卡牌","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1}]}
