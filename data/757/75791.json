Austin）。Lena遇到性格叛逆的少女Callie（Maia Mitchell），对她的身世产生了浓厚兴趣——Callie也是一个被人收养的孩子，但她总是遭到虐待，已经在多个收养家庭中反复进出过很多次。Lena和Stef十分同情Callie的遭遇，决定将她接到自己家中生活几周时间——直到给她找到一个合适的安身之处。\r\n\r\nCallie很快意识到这是个「非典型」家庭，她口无遮拦的话语引起了Jesus和Mariana的紧张——他们最不愿意听人谈论起自己的「养子养女」身份，而这偏偏是Callie最感「兴趣」的话题。当这对双胞胎有机会与亲生母亲见面时，他们开始犹豫起来——他们是否做好了与她相认的准备？他们是否应该把这件事告诉两个养母？另一方面，Callie还发现Mariana隐瞒了一个秘密——一个可能给她带来大麻烦的秘密。\r\n\r\nBrandon是一个很有音乐天赋的孩子，心地善良。当Lena安排Callie到自己工作的高中读书时，Brandon不仅主动帮助Callie与同学们打交道，还帮助她应付各种「社交难题」。当Callie决定逃学去见她曾经认识的某人时，Brandon面临一个艰难的选择。\r\n\r\n接下来的事情取决于Stef和Lena的决定——她们是否应该给Callie一个机会？她们家中是否会有Callie的一席之地？她们心中是否会有Callie的一席之地？或许，她们会让Callie永远留下来，真正成为这个家庭的一分子？\r\n\r\n（简介转自人人影视）","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>如此一家人</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>星期一</li><li><span>别名: </span>寄养家庭</li><li><span>集数: </span>20</li><li><span>开始: </span>2013-06-03</li><li><span>结束: </span>2013-XX-XX</li><li><span>类型: </span>剧情/生活/青春</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>42分钟</li><li><span>频道: </span>ABC Family</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://beta.abcfamily.go.com/shows/the-fosters</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt2262532</li><li><span>wikipedia: </span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fosters_(2013_TV_series)</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2,"doing":2,"on_hold":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"美剧","count":5},{"name":"TV","count":3},{"name":"新季","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":281761,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281761","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Pilot","name_cn":"","duration":"00:45:25","airdate":"2013-06-03","comment":0,"desc":"Callie, a troubled teen, is sent to live with The Fosters after getting beat up in Juvie. The Fosters, Stef, a police officer, and Lena, a vice-principal, are an interracial married lesbian couple raising Brandon, Stef's biological son from a previous marriage, and their adopted twins Mariana and Jesus. Brandon makes it to the finals of a music competition where the prize is a $5,000 dollar scholarship. Unknown to the family, Mariana is selling Jesus' ADD medication to get money which she has been giving to Ana, her biological mother, whom she has been meeting in secret. The night that Callie comes to stay, she borrows Brandon's cell phone and calls someone named Jude, telling him she is going to come and get him. At work, Stef is partnered with her ex-husband Mike, who is also a cop, after her previous partner transfers. Meanwhile, Callie is determined to get to Jude. After several failed attempts to find a ride, Mariana tells Callie that there is a back exit to the school and a bus stop three blocks away. Callie ditches school, which Brandon sees and follows her. While following her, Jude keeps calling Brandon's phone. Callie answers the call and tries to talk to Jude, desperate to know if he is okay, but he is quickly taken off the phone by someone whom Callie clearly doesn't like. She tries to leave to go to him, but Brandon demands answers, now concerned. Callie finally tells him that Jude is her younger brother and she refuses to leave him with their foster father and must get him. Brandon refuses to let her go alone and goes with her.\r\nOn the bus, Callie reveals to Brandon that her foster father physically hurt her and when he caught Jude wearing a dress, started beating him as well. When she tried to intervene, he kicked her in her stomach. In an attempt to distract him from beating Jude, she took a baseball bat to his car. When the cops came, he insisted that Callie was crazy and he had strictly been defending himself. Not bothering to hear her side of the story, she was sent to Juvie. Meanwhile, the rest of the Fosters are getting ready for Brandon's music competition and become worried when they can't find him or Callie. After Stef tracks his phone, they find out where they are at and quickly leave. After arriving at her foster father's house, Brandon distracts him while Callie tries to get to Jude from the back. Things go south when he quickly notices Callie and begins shoving her, demanding she leave, but Callie refuses to leave without Jude. The foster father then pulls out a gun. Stef, Mike, and Lena arrive just in time and the foster father is arrested. Callie and Jude are reunited as Brandon explains to Lena about who Jude is. While talking to Callie, Stef refuses to send Callie and Jude back into the system just yet. She and Lena allow Jude and Callie to stay with them.","status":"Air"},{"id":281762,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/281762","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Consequently","name_cn":"","duration":"00:42:43","airdate":"2013-06-10","comment":0,"desc":"Lena and Stef decide to let Brandon off the hook for running off with Callie to rescue Jude, but Mike disagrees and tensions flare.
