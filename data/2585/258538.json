Unlike the Genesis version, the sprites are about the same size as the arcade game, which makes the playing field a little cramped. Some of the graphical effects haven’t made the transition, but otherwise it’s much more colorful than the Sega version. Many of the bosses are completely different, some having been taken from Super Darius. There are a few difficulty modes – in the easiest one, your weapons don’t power down after dying. However, far and away the biggest advantage is the soundtrack. Rather than the usual Zuntata weirdness, Super Darius II is full of rocking, guitar-driven music that flat out rules. Some of the arrangements are so drastic though that it’s hard to pick out the base of the original song. While the opening speech is gone, this is probably the best version to go after. This was released on the Wii Virtual Console.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超级大流士战机II</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1279\">NECアベニュー</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Super Darius II</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>超级太空战斗机II</li><li><span>平台: </span>PCE CD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii VC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>横版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年12月24日</li><li><span>开发: </span>A-Wave</li>","staff":[{"id":1279,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ea/9d/1279_prsn_A9ngn.jpg","name":"NECアベニュー","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":79295,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0e/e9/79295_3NnLA.jpg","title":"ダライアスII","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/79295"}]}
