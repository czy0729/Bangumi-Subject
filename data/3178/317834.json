It was developed in 1983 and released in June 1984. Atari originally intended to release the game in 1983, but it was delayed due to technical issues and difficulties, so it was returned to the lab for further testing and research, and was not fully released until June 1984.\r\n\r\nI, Robot is known for being the first commercially produced video game with filled 3D polygon graphics with flat shading, as well as being the first video game to feature camera-control options. Its name was originally \"Ice Castles\", but was changed to \"I, Robot\".\r\n\r\nIn I, Robot, the player controls \"Unhappy Interface Robot #1984\", a servant robot that has become self-aware and decides to rebel against Big Brother. To advance from level to level, the robot must destroy the giant blinking eye of Big Brother, first by wearing down its shield and then attacking the eye directly. The robot fires energy at the shield by moving over red blocks in the level, converting them to blue.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>遊戲設計師: </span><a href=\"/person/39079\">Dave Theurer</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1984年6月</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Dave Theurer</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"发行"},{"id":39079,"image":"","name":"Dave Theurer","desc":"遊戲設計師"}]}
