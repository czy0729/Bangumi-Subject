The objective is to defeat the boss at the end of each stage, defeating enemies and collecting bonuses on the way. Killing an enemy makes them drop a small golden item. After picking up a specified amount of these items, the item rank is increased and the gold items change and become worth more points. The item rank goes seven steps before all gold items get max value. Getting hit or failing to collect a gold items decreases the item rank. Any bullets that are close to an enemy when the enemy is destroyed is converted into fruit bonus items. These have a given point value and is not affected by or affects item rank. Bosses and mini-bosses drop a large number of fruit bonus items on death. An item does not have to be touched to be collected, it is enough to fly close to an item to auto-collect it.
