The player can compete in a tournament, playing against opponents who visit the Café, or can practice against each opponent to find out his/her/its weakness in a single-player match.\r\n\r\nThe game is controlled via the computer's mouse. The bat on the playing field bounces a hockey puck between the player and the opponent. When one of the players manages to knock the hockey puck past the opponent's bat, the player scores.\r\n\r\nAfter a set number of points (usually 15) the match is over.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>冰球咖啡馆</li><li><span>别名: </span>星际咖啡厅</li><li><span>平台: </span>Macintosh (original)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SIM</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1989</li>","collection":{"collect":5},"tags":[{"name":"FC","count":2},{"name":"磁碟机","count":1},{"name":"我的童年","count":1}]}
