While the giant is off visiting his friend the ogre, children play in the garden; when he returns, he chases them away and builds a high wall around the garden to keep out all trespassers. Winter comes to call, and a perpetual bleak chill settles on the garden, and the giant grows increasingly lonely, until the children find their way back in, and break the spell that keeps spring out. The giant opens his heart to them, and from them (one in particular) learns of the mysterious power of love. \r\n　　- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \r\n　　The Selfish Giant is an animated short film adaptation of the short story by Oscar Wilde.
