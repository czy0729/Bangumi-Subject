{"id":243301,"type":2,"name":"Noah's Ark（1959）","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ef/eb/243301_869L1.jpg","summary":"　　The well-known biblical tale is brought to life as a stop-motion musical, which feels more like Rankin/Bass's specials in the medium than a Disney production, only it's more stylized. Noah is advised by a heavenly voice that a great rainstorm is coming which will wipe out most of Earth's inhabitants. So he and his three sons build a boat to precise specifications and begin rounding up two animals of every kind, plus of course, their own women. When the lengthy time on the boat brings spirits down, Noah's sons provide some music to cheer everyone up. Interestingly, household items are used to create the characters; the whooping cranes have pencil beaks, corks are abound, and the moose's antlers are really sporks. This is a Disney oddity, if ever there was one, but it offers quite a fun time.\r\n","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>诺亚方舟</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1959-11-10</li><li><span>片长: </span>19分钟</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧 / 动画 / 短片 / 歌舞 / 家庭 / 奇幻</li><li><span>导演: </span>Bill Justice</li><li><span>编剧: </span>T.
