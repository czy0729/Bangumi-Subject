You have to clash your card with neighbouring cards to move it. Monster cards and trap cards will decrease your card's health, healing cards will... well, heal you, cards with loot will increase your game score and there are also heaps of other cards with unique abilities and behaviors. It may sound complicated but the rules are very easy to pick up once you start playing.\r\n\r\nThe game is also built with a classical roguelite formula: it is a turn-based dungeon crawler in a fantasy setting with selectable characters, procedurally generated dungeons, pixel art graphics and the permadeath. It even has a \"Rogue\" character class! You can't get more rogue than that =)\r\n\r\nOk, the game is a card roguelike, but is it fun? Oh, the hell it is! You can totally trust me on this, as a developer I am unbiased =) Each movement of your card creates a unique and challenging situation, a mini-puzzle which requires strategic thinking to solve, and solving all that puzzles rewards you with the sense of pride and achievement that quickly becomes addictive.\r\n\r\nSo, stop reading this keywords-filled marketing text, choose one of the five heroes, descend into the magical dungeon, avoid devious traps and fight through hordes of monsters in quest of epic loot!","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>Android</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>卡牌</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unity</li>","collection":{"collect":2,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"Android","count":1}]}
