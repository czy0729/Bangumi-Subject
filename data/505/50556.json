One of the most touted features of the game is the choice between nine different races when playing multiplayer (the single player story revolves around the humans, but you do get to command different races). The races are split into different categories like primitive, civilized, and magical that will link them to different building structures and good, evil, and neutral alignments that will give certain advantages and disadvantages to each race. You also get to use heroes that travel with you throughout all of your games and cannot die permanently.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>呼啸战神</li><li><span>平台: </span>Win</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RTS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2000-5</li><li><span>售价: </span>$9.99</li><li><span>制作公司: </span>SSG (Strategic Studies Group)</li><li><span>发行公司: </span>Mattel Interactive</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"relations":[{"id":50557,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/34/aa/50557_AQM1X.jpg","title":"Warlords Battlecry II","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/50557"}]}
