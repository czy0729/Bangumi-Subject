The game is a sequel to The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, which was remade and included along with the Assault on Dark Athena campaign. The game was released on April 7, 2009, developed by Starbreeze Studios and published by Atari. According to Ian Stevens, Head of Production at Tigon Studios, the decision to do a remake was because Microsoft could not make the Xbox 360 backward compatible with Escape from Butcher Bay, and because they wanted to get the Escape story to a larger audience before progressing further.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超世纪战警：暗黑雅典娜</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/20361\">Starbreeze Studios</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17916\">Atari, Inc</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox360</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AAVG / FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2009年4月7日</li>","collection":{"wish":1},"tags":[{"name":"潜行","count":1},{"name":"AAVG","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"FPS","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":20361,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/98/b1/20361_prsn_G2FgJ.jpg","name":"星风工作室","desc":"开发"},{"id":17916,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/57/6a/17916_prsn_FZygZ.jpg","name":"雅达利公司","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":241859,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/8d/15/241859_rrUOx.jpg","title":"The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/241859"}]}
