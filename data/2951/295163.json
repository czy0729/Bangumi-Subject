The series focuses on Michael Kerrigan (Sean Bean), the priest of a Roman Catholic parish in a northern English city, who despite suffering from his own troubles stemming from a traumatic childhood, tries to guide several of his most vulnerable parishioners through the trials and tribulations of everyday life. The series, produced by LA Productions, was commissioned in 2015; with filming taking place throughout 2016.\r\n\r\nThe series was originally due to begin on 23 May, but the broadcast was postponed following the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing the previous night, and was replaced in the schedules by a repeat of Planet Earth II.This was due to the nature of the storyline in the first episode, which focuses on mum-of-three Christina Fitzsimmons (Anna Friel), who after losing her job, resorts to keeping her mother's death a secret in order to continue claiming her state pension.\r\n\r\nThe series was directed by Ashley Pearce and Noreen Kershaw; while Shaun Duggan, Colette Kane and Nick Leather all contributed to McGovern's scripts. The series was released on DVD on 10 July 2017.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>破碎</li><li><span>别名: </span>救世神父</li><li><span>集数: </span>6</li><li><span>开始: </span>2017-05-30</li><li><span>结束: </span>2017-07-04</li><li><span>类型: </span>剧情</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>60min</li><li><span>频道: </span>BBC</li><li><span>Created: </span>Jimmy McGovern</li><li><span>Written: </span>Jimmy McGovern</li><li><span>Starring: </span>Sean Bean Adrian Dunbar Anna Friel Muna Otaru Mark Stanley Aisling Loftus Paula Malcolmson Ned Dennehy Danny Sapani</li><li><span>Original network: </span>BBC One</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt6078644</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"BBC","count":1},{"name":"英剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":919215,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/919215","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Christina","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"30 May 2017","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":919216,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/919216","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Helen","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"6 June 2017","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":919217,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/919217","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Andrew","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"13 June 2017","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":919218,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/919218","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Roz","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"20 June 2017","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":919219,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/919219","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Carl","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"27 June 2017","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":919220,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/919220","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Father Michael","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"4 July 2017","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
