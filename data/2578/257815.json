The second installment in the Crush Pinball series after Alien Crush, the game has an eerie occult theme with skulls, skeletons, and demons. It was later followed by Jaki Crush and Alien Crush Returns.\r\nThe game was ported to the Sega Genesis, retitled Dragon's Fury (Devil Crash MD in Japan) by developer Technosoft. Both North American versions, TurboGrafx-16 and Genesis, contain some minor censorship. Devil's Crush was later released on the Wii's Virtual Console, with the European release reverting to its original title; however, the pentagram symbols were removed and replaced with 8-sided star.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>恶魔弹珠台</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32942\">コンパイル</a> (PCE)、<a href=\"/person/38925\">テクノソフト</a> (MD)</li><li><span>别名: </span>DEVIL CRUSH</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Devil's Crush</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Dragon's Fury</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>デビルクラッシュMD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>魔鬼崩溃</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>魔幻弹珠台</li><li><span>平台: </span>PCE</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>VC (Wii, Wii U)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PSN</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Pinball</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人 (交互)</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1990年7月20日</li><li><span>发行: </span>ナグザット (NAXAT Soft)</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":32942,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5a/9e/32942_prsn_MIk3k.jpg","name":"Compile","desc":"开发"},{"id":38925,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/1f/dc/38925_prsn_qZ9Pg.jpg","name":"Technosoft","desc":"开发"}]}
