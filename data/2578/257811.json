Air Zonk was an attempt to update the company's image via a modern, punkish character called Zonk, who bears a purposeful resemblance to the TurboGrafx-16's caveman mascot, Bonk.\r\nThe game was developed by Red, better known for their Gate of Thunder series. Air Zonk features King Drool, antagonist of the Bonk series, along with many other enemies from the series. It was followed by a sequel in 1993 called Super Air Zonk: Rockabilly-Paradise for the Turbo Duo, and has been released on the Wii's Virtual Console.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>PC电人</li><li><span>开发: </span>Naxat Soft、<a href=\"/person/992\">レッド・エンタテインメント</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17867\">ハドソン</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Air Zonk</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>PC Denjin</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Punkic Cyborg!</li><li><span>平台: </span>PCE</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii VC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>横版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年11月20日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":992,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/86/d8/992_prsn_Qqw5Q.jpg","name":"Red Entertainment","desc":"开发"},{"id":17867,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/c9/3b/17867_prsn_rFzfI.jpg","name":"ハドソン","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":253440,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/1c/cf/253440_zVzIB.jpg","title":"PC原人","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/253440"}]}
