It is a one-on-one fighting game set on large stages that change dynamically over the course of a battle. Players must use weapons to attack the other player while also avoiding the dangers and havoc brought on by various stage gimmicks. Although the game did not attract much interest at release, it has gained recognition in retrospect for the variety and dynamic elements in its game design, and for its outlandish and bizarre action themes. Critics have compared its style to action films and games developed by Goichi Suda. The Outfoxies is also recognized for pioneering gameplay elements seen in later arena fighting games, particularly the Super Smash Bros. series.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>异域战狐</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>The Outfoxies</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995年3月</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"staff":[{"id":1598,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9c/19/1598_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"南梦宫","desc":"开发"}]}
