Players assume the role of a character with various statistics such as combat ability, morale, and magical affinity. A character's predisposition toward individual attributes and spells is determined by the selection of one of four professions at the start of the game. During play, the player takes on quests as part of the main storyline, as well as accepting side quests in order to gain items, experience and gold. Gold can be used to buy equipment that offers bonuses in combat, or it can be used to build up a citadel that unlocks additional content and customization for the character.\r\n\r\nThe game uses a simple map, and as players accept quests, new towns, cities, and other points of interest appear as available destinations. Each location is connected together by roads, and foes periodically appear between locations, blocking movement until they are defeated. Key quest locations are also marked on the map, and completing quests typically involves visiting such locations in order to defeat one or more opponents in one-on-one battles.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>益智之谜：战神的挑战</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/7397\">ディースリー・パブリッシャー</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>谜题任务：挑战军阀</li><li><span>平台: </span>Wii</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PSP</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NDS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2007-3-16</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.d3publisher.us/</li><li><span>开发: </span>Infinite Interactive Engine Software</li>","collection":{"collect":22,"doing":1,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"PUZ","count":3},{"name":"PC","count":3},{"name":"普通游戏","count":1},{"name":"NDS","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":7397,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/2c/47/7397_prsn_qT0Zk.jpg","name":"ディースリー・パブリッシャー","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":30118,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4a/d7/30118_PS6NN.jpg","title":"Puzzle Quest 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/30118"}],"like":[{"id":130,"name":"雷顿教授与不可思议的小镇","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9b/86/130_S6sjz.jpg"},{"id":2972,"name":"名侦探柯南 贝克街的亡灵","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0f/21/2972_p7Bso.jpg"},{"id":290,"name":"Fate/stay night","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f9/0f/290_6Qi5Q.jpg"},{"id":1859,"name":"植物大战僵尸","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/53/7d/1859_RuRuF.jpg"},{"id":10639,"name":"Fate/Zero","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/86/1f/10639_w4sHs.jpg"},{"id":10380,"name":"命运石之门","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a9/79/10380_YwP4R.jpg"},{"id":1952,"name":"迦南","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/11/13/1952_NkgN5.jpg"}]}
