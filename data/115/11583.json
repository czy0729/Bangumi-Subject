{"id":11583,"type":6,"name":"Spooks (season 4)","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/1f/a9/11583_j3F7f.jpg","rating":{"total":1,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":1,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0},"score":7},"summary":"The fourth series of Spooks began transmission on Monday 12 September 2005 on BBC One at 9 pm with the first of a two-part story. The next day (13 September) the second episode was shown. The following week Spooks assumed a 9 pm Thursday slot, a break from the Monday 9 pm slot the previous series had traditionally occupied. Once again the series ran for 10 episodes and averaged 6.05 million viewers, a notable increase on the previous series.[9]\r\n\r\nThe opening two part episode introduces two new characters to the series, Zafar Younis (Raza Jaffrey, whose character had debuted in the final episode of series three), and Juliet Shaw (Anna Chancellor). The storyline involves a terrorist bombing central London, something that, in reality, took place on 7 July, two months prior to the airing but already after the filming was complete.\r\n\r\nAccording to The Guardian newspaper, the day the first episode aired, \"The similarities were sufficient to cause head of drama Jane Tranter and new BBC One controller Peter Fincham to agonise over whether to drop the episodes.\"[10] The episodes eventually aired unedited, although before both installments of the two-parter the BBC One continuity announcer warned viewers that they featured scenes of terrorist bombing in London which some viewers might find disturbing.\r\n\r\nIn episode seven, Fiona Carter leaves the show because the actress portraying her, Olga Sosnovska, was pregnant during filming and chose to leave the programme. In that story arc, Adam attempts to kill Fiona's deranged ex-husband, who she thought was hanged several years prior. However, her ex-husband ultimately abducts her and later shoots her dead in Adam's presence during her attempted escape. Her character is replaced by Jo Portman (played by Miranda Raison), a new arrival at MI5 who was recruited by Adam in a previous episode.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>神出鬼没（第四季）</li><li><span>别名: </span>军情五处（第四季）</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>MI5</li><li><span>集数: </span>10</li><li><span>开始: </span>2005-09-12</li><li><span>结束: </span>2005-11-10</li><li><span>类型: </span>spy</li><li><span>导演: </span>David Wolstencroft</li><li><span>主演: </span>Peter Firth / Hugh Simon / Rupert Penry-Jones / Nicola Walker / Rory MacGregor</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>60min</li><li><span>电视台: </span>BBC</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mf4b</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"RPJ","count":1},{"name":"军情五处","count":1},{"name":"spy","count":1},{"name":"英剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":67069,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/67069","type":0,"sort":1,"name":""The Special (Part 1)"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"12 September 2005","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":67070,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/67070","type":0,"sort":2,"name":""The Special (Part 2)"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"13 September 2005","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":67071,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/67071","type":0,"sort":3,"name":""Divided They Fall"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"22 September 2005","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":67072,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/67072","type":0,"sort":4,"name":""Road Trip"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"29 September 2005","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":67073,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/67073","type":0,"sort":5,"name":""The Book"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"6 October 2005","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":67074,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/67074","type":0,"sort":6,"name":""The Innocent"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"13 October 2005","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":67075,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/67075","type":0,"sort":7,"name":""Syria"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"20 October 2005","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":67076,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/67076","type":0,"sort":8,"name":""The Russian"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"27 October 2005","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":67077,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/67077","type":0,"sort":9,"name":""The Sting"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"3 November 2005","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":67078,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/67078","type":0,"sort":10,"name":""Diana"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"10 November 2005","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":11248,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/17/8f/11248_6t5Vc.jpg","title":"Spooks (season 3)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/11248"}]}
