Umihara Kawase contains a total of 49 fields of which four are exit fields and six are boss fields. The game makes good use of the SFC's colour palette for digitized photographic backgrounds. The rope physics sometimes strain the Super Famicom's CPU, leading to slowdown, but this is rare. The game permits saving speedruns, establishing such play as a principle feature of the series.\r\nThe game, along with Shun, was ported for PC in 2015. The slowdown from the Super Famicom version is no longer present though the game remains largely the same with the addition of a practice mode.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>うみはらかわせ</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Umihara Kawase</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年12月23日</li><li><span>开发: </span>TNN</li><li><span>发行: </span>TNN</li>","collection":{"wish":5,"collect":3,"doing":1,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"Platform","count":2},{"name":"SFC","count":2},{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"ACT","count":2}],"relations":[{"id":80700,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ea/a1/80700_yEzYe.jpg","title":"海腹川背・旬","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/80700"},{"id":304740,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f8/73/304740_AcRmw.jpg","title":"海腹川背 BaZooKa!","type":"资料片、外传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/304740"},{"id":216938,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/27/d0/216938_CZh9h.jpg","title":"Blade Strangers","type":"角色出演","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/216938"},{"id":311648,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3d/1b/311648_4MGQa.jpg","title":"Crystal Crisis","type":"角色出演","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/311648"}]}
