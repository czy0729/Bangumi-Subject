{"id":162824,"type":4,"name":"Amplitude","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/04/6b/162824_0uDS3.jpg","summary":"Amplitude features over 20 songs composed for an optimal beatmatching experience by Harmonix with contributions from Freezepop, Danny B, Jim Guthrie, and more. Many of the developers from the original game are actively working on the reboot.\r\n\r\nThe new Amplitude will be treated like a classic, sci-fi concept album. There is a narrative that runs through the game and surfaces in many ways through the visuals, music and song lyrics. \r\n\r\nPlayers will speed down long, winding paths made up of the different musical elements of a song. Each track is differentiated with the musical sounds of synthesizers, drums, vocals, and bass. As players blast away the patterns of gems on these tracks, they release musical energy and recreate the hidden song within.\r\n\r\nGameplay remains easy to pick up and difficult to master. Achieving a top score will be a challenge and therefore worth bragging about via online leaderboards.\r\n\r\nAmplitude supports up to four players locally. Challenge your friends and use devastating power-ups during frenetic multiplayer matches to secure your place at the top.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>振幅</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>MUG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2016年1月5日</li><li><span>售价: </span>19.99美元</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/amplitude-ps4/</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1}}
