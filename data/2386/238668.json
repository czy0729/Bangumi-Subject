Every beat indicates which saber you need to use and also the direction you need to match. All the music is composed to perfectly fit the hand made levels. Our goal is to make players almost dance while cutting the cubes and avoiding obstacles. Each cut is strongly supported by great sound and visual effects to emphasize the rhythm.\r\nFeatures\r\nUnique gameplay with a great feel - Beat Saber combines the satisfying feeling of cutting with emergent perception of rhythm.\r\nHandcrafted levels & music - All the basic levels and music in the game will be handcrafted to emphasise the music rhythm. The results are incomparable to similar games with generated content.\r\nGame accessibility - Anyone can understand basic game principles and play the game in just a few seconds.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>节奏光剑</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS VR</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>STEAM</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>VRMUG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2018年</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.beatsaber.com/</li><li><span>开发: </span>Hyperbolic Magnetism</li><li><span>发行: </span>Hyperbolic Magnetism</li>","collection":{"wish":17,"collect":23,"doing":6,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"VR","count":7},{"name":"音游","count":3},{"name":"STEAM","count":3},{"name":"音乐","count":2},{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"PS4","count":2},{"name":"MUG","count":1},{"name":"看过视频","count":1}]}
