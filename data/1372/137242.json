Saw this tonight as part of a short film program at a The Chauvel Cinema in Sydney. Dream Doll was Oscar nominated in the Animation category. If anyone ever reads these reviews, I would strongly recommend you source both the films to make your own comparison. My preference is still far and away with the Le Ballon Rouge - this won the Grand Prize at Cannes and the Academy Award for Best Short Film in 1957. A good film to accompany Dream Doll is another Bob Godfrey Oscar nominated animated short film: Kama Sutra Rides Again. This was also on the program tonight.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>梦幻玩偶</li><li><span>别名: </span>Zemlja Snova / LUTKA SNOVA</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1979</li><li><span>片长: </span>11:05</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>www.zagrebfilm.hr/katalog_film_detail_e.asp?sif=368</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>英国 / 南斯拉夫</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>导演: </span>Bob Godfrey / Zlatko Grgić</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Stephen Penn</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":3,"doing":1,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":1}]}
