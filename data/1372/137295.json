{"id":137295,"type":2,"name":"The Saint Inspector","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/dc/78/137295_BZ7AQ.jpg","summary":"　　Like a good short film should, The Saint Inspector makes up for in quality what it loses in length. The narrative is deliciously one-dimensional and simple (there's a saint, there's a saint inspector: the latter inspects the first) but the visual flair and style and the overall impact are stunning. Psychedelics on celluloid! If you like: check out the feature-length \"The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb\" (1993) by the same production company.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>圣人检查员</li><li><span>别名: </span>O Santo Inspector</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1996</li><li><span>片长: </span>5min</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>无对白</li><li><span>导演: </span>Mike Booth</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2,"dropped":2}}
