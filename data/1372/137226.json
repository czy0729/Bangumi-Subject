It's a high result of mixing 2d and 3d: the characters are made in 3d cellshading and the remains in 2d. \r\n　　This silent mute is pure poetry. \r\n　　A man alone, with his peculiar physique: he has his head held low, looking down at the ground. \r\n　　Clapin needs only few minutes to show you the emotional state of this man: his loneliness and his quest for a human being like him. A profound analysis of alienation and frustation of people: man needs to live with other men.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>脊椎的故事</li><li><span>别名: </span>{向下看，向上望！ / A Backbone Tale</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2006</li><li><span>片长: </span>9:10</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>法国</li><li><span>语言: </span>法语</li><li><span>导演: </span>Jérémy Clapin</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Jérémy Clapin</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":5,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":2}]}
