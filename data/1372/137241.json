When Wilshire Pig and Sheldon Snail coming across a map detailing the works of Dr. Frankenswine (who apparently created a monster out of dead bodies), they decide to go to the castle where he worked. Sure enough, the castle's all full of monsters and things...meaning that Wilshire and Sheldon aren't lucky to be alive. But boy does everyone have a surprise coming! This just goes to show that you don't need an hour and a half to make a good story. As always, Will Vinton has something clever up his sleeve at every turn. This is one cartoon that you're sure to like. It's too bad that Phil Knight fired Will Vinton from his own business.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>错中错</li><li><span>别名: </span>Claymation Comedy of Horrors Show / Ahne sika matkalla maineeseen</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1991-05-29</li><li><span>片长: </span>24min</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>导演: </span>Will Vinton / Bruce Barry</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Barry Bruce / Mark Gustafson</li><li><span>主演: </span>Tim Conner / Brian Cummings / Krisha Fairchild / Todd Tolces</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":2}}
