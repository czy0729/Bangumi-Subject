Stunning cel animation propels its blank-faced protagonist into the world of the phallus, rendered here as a field of asparagus, which she deep throats, excretes and flushes away...The film's stunning set piece occurs before a claymation audience who gape as the artist opens her Medusa's box to release rare wonders. A moving meditation on art and the cost of reproduction, Asparagus remains, twenty-five years after its release, a benchmark of single frame intensity.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>芦笋</li><li><span>别名: </span>芦吮</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1979</li><li><span>片长: </span>18:13</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>导演: </span>Suzan Pitt</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Suzan Pitt</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>home.earthlink.net/~suzanpitt/id9.html</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":4,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"1979","count":1},{"name":"欧美","count":1},{"name":"短片","count":1}]}
