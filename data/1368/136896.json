Unfortunately, the young man's ferocious playing style rouses up a storm which causes the waves to sweep a young woman (who was gathering shrimp by the shore) out to sea. The heroic cellist dives in to save the woman and finds himself battling some sea creatures for posession of both the woman and his cello.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>姑娘与大提琴演奏手</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>别名: </span>The Lady and the Cellist</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1965年6月2日</li><li><span>片长: </span>9分钟</li><li><span>其他: </span>无对白</li><li><span>IMDb链接: </span>tt0414942</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>法国</li><li><span>导演: </span>Jean-François Laguionie</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Jean-François Laguionie</li><li><span>制片人: </span>Paul Grimault</li>","collection":{"collect":9,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":2},{"name":"1965","count":1},{"name":"欧美","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":913384,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/913384","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
