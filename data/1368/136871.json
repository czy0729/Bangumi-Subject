Only a kiss of her lover can save her now...","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>煤黑德萨宾矮人</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>别名: </span>So White and de sebben dwarfs</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1943-01-16(美国)</li><li><span>片长: </span>7分35秒</li><li><span>IMDb链接: </span>tt0035743</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧 / 动画 / 短片 / 歌舞 / 家庭</li><li><span>导演: </span>Robert Clampett</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Warren Foster / 雅各布·格林 / 威廉·格林</li><li><span>主演: </span>Mel Blanc / Ruby Dandridge / Vivian Dandridge / Zoot Watson / Danny Webb</li>","collection":{"wish":4,"collect":16},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":6},{"name":"1943","count":4},{"name":"欧美","count":2},{"name":"RobertClampett","count":1},{"name":"RubyDandridge","count":1},{"name":"百佳动画","count":1},{"name":"WarrenFoster","count":1},{"name":"MelBlanc","count":1},{"name":"华纳","count":1},{"name":"WarnerBros.Animation","count":1},{"name":"美国动画","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":913544,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/913544","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
