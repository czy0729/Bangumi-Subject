Years later, after Holstrom's death, Logorythms continues his project, using various illegal and unethical means to reach their goals.\r\n\r\nShaken by the death of her beloved father's two years prior, Madison \"Maddie\" Kim is a bullied teen who receives mysterious help from someone online, who is soon thereafter revealed to be her deceased father, David Kim. David explains that his consciousness has been successfully uploaded to Logorhythms' cloud following an experimental and destructive brain scan, and that Logorythms lied to his family about the results. Wanting to save her father, Maddie seeks help from others and eventually gains custody of her father's U.I., but the Kim family is still facing danger from Logorythms.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Caspian Keyes, a troubled yet highly intelligent teenage boy is embroiled in his own intrigue involving Logorythms. Since birth, Caspian's life has been a lie, raised unaware that he is in a constructed environment and constantly monitored by Logorythms, to one day fulfill a specific purpose. Through a chatroom, Caspian comes into contact with Maddie and the two aid each other in searching for the truth, which also helps Caspian gradually learn the truth about his reality.\r\n\r\nVinod Chanda, an engineer from the India-based Alliance Telecom company, wishes to use U.I. technology to usher in a digital utopia. After meeting with a rival company, Chanda's corrupt boss has him kidnapped and reveals that Alliance Telecom has secretly been conducting U.I. experiments, and Chanda himself is scanned, resulting in his death in the real world with his U.I. uploaded to perform menial tasks within Alliance's systems. With help from previous U.I. victims, Chanda escapes his virtual prison and becomes a rogue wildcard.\r\n\r\nWith Maddie and Caspian stuck in the middle, a global conspiracy unfolds that threatens to trigger a new kind of world war.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>万神殿</li><li><span>话数: </span>8</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2022年9月1日</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>星期四</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.amcstudiosinternational.com/catalog/17874</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2022年10月13日</li><li><span>Copyright: </span>© 2022 AMC Film Holdings LLC.
