It is the sequel to The Conduit. The definite article of the original title was dropped during development as the developers considered it \"too much of a mouthful\".\r\n\r\nThe game makes use of the Quantum3 engine, a game engine designed by High Voltage Software specifically for the Wii. The engine allows effects such as bump mapping, reflection and refraction, and gloss and detail mapping to be implemented. Conduit 2 supports a wide variety of peripherals such as Wii MotionPlus, Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro, and the PDP Headbanger Headset.\r\n\r\nConduit 2 released to mixed reviews, and failed to meet sales expectations. Despite the game ending on a cliffhanger, High Voltage Software has been reluctant to develop a third Conduit game.[citation needed] A Nintendo 3DS port was also revealed to be in development prior to the game's release, but there was no further word on when or whether it would ever be released.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>管道2</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Wii</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Quantum3</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2011年4月19日</li><li><span>开发: </span>High Voltage Software</li>","staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":83138,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/08/18/83138_hdjhn.jpg","title":"The Conduit","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/83138"}]}
