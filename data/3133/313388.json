A disembodied voice tells you that you have been trapped in a time loop with your future self. They have committed a terrible crime in the near future, and - according to this voice - the only way you can escape the loop is to convince your future self of the wrongness of their actions.\r\n\r\nIt seems you have no choice but to follow their instructions, but that doesn't mean you should believe everything they say. As you progress in your conversation with your future self, it becomes very apparent that something is amiss. Someone is lying to you. The question is: who? And why?\r\n\r\nIf you want to be free, make sure you figure out the truth.\r\n\r\nThink carefully. Think strategically.\r\n\r\n...and good luck.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Text-Based Adventure Games</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unity</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019-3-8</li><li><span>售价: </span>‎US$2.99</li>","collection":{"collect":3}}
