Regular customers Leon, Kurt, Nick and Marsha arrive and argue about politics and sport. Horace tries to ask Uncle Pete not to attend the afternoon's meeting with Sylvia and her lawyer over the future of the bar, fearing he will inflame the situation, but this only infuriates him. Horace has been trying to contact his daughter Alice all day when she unexpectedly visits. She rebuffs his attempts to connect with her, and declines his offer to let her stay at the upstairs apartment despite having accommodation problems. Pete has been acting strangely all day; he can no longer afford to take his expensive medication due to an insurance mix-up. He has a meltdown and scares away most of the customers. An accountant (Peter Benson) who was sent by Sylvia's lawyer asks some awkward questions about the bar's finances. Sylvia arrives with her lawyer (Stephen Wallem) and gives notice that she intends to sue the bar for her share of the inheritance and to sell it. Uncle Pete reveals that he is Pete's true father, but he gave him up to be raised by Horace's father. Amid the bickering, Pete unexpectedly becomes the voice of reason. Horace abruptly asks his girlfriend Rachel (Rebecca Hall) to move out.","status":"Air"},{"id":615191,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/615191","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"2","name_cn":"","duration":"00:50:44","airdate":"2016-02-06","comment":0,"desc":"Horace is awakened by Marsha, who flirts with him; it later becomes clear that this is Horace's strange sexual fantasy. Horace and Pete talk about the afterlife over breakfast. Marsha brings Dennis the tire store entrepreneur (Jack O'Connell) into the bar on a date. Sylvia tells Horace she has breast cancer, and reveals she wants to sell the bar to pay medical bills. Horace goes to lunch with Alice. They are starting to get on better until he explains that he kicked out Rachel so that she could move in. She again declines his offer. Horace goes upstairs and has another strange fantasy about Marsha. Meanwhile in the bar, Dennis is becoming frustrated with Marsha - he wants to take her out on the town, she just wants to sit in the bar and drink. He finally admits that he is married. Pete is visited by Tricia, a woman with Tourette syndrome he met while he was in a psychiatric hospital.","status":"Air"},{"id":615192,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/615192","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"3","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-02-13","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":619704,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/619704","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"4","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-02-20","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":619705,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/619705","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"5","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-02-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":619706,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/619706","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"6","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-03-05","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":621734,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/621734","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"7","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-03-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":624715,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/624715","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"8","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-03-19","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":624716,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/624716","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"9","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-03-26","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":628418,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/628418","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"10","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-04-02","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
