He was a normal high school senior with a normal part-time job and otherwise normal life, except his father Nolan is the superhero Omni-Man, the most powerful superhero on the planet. At the age of 17, Mark begins to display superpowers, which come from his father being a member of the Viltrumite race, who, according to Nolan, pioneer the galaxy on a mission of benevolence and enlightenment.\r\n\r\nAs Invincible, Mark begins working as a superhero, with his father acting as his mentor, and meeting other heroes (including Robot, Rex Splode, Dupli-Kate and Atom Eve), discovering that his Physics teacher has been turning his students into human bombs, to foiling a plan by the Mauler Twins to make an army of robots. Meanwhile Omni-Man is kidnapped by aliens, taken to another dimension, but returns after what seems to be only a few days, but was actually eight months to him.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>无敌少侠</li><li><span>册数: </span>25</li><li><span>话数: </span>144</li><li><span>出版社: </span>Image Comics</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2003-11-02</li><li><span>作者: </span>Robert Kirkman、Cory Walker、Ryan Ottley</li><li><span>开始: </span>2003-01-22</li><li><span>结束: </span>2018-02-14</li>","relations":[{"id":331646,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3c/21/331646_ot1R1.jpg","title":"Invincible","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/331646"}]}
