However, despite not being the original, the Amiga version was the one that was first commercially released in 1993, published by Rainbow Arts in Germany and Renegade in the rest of Europe. The Mega Drive version did not have a publisher and stayed unreleased from spring 1993 until 1994, when Data East took over its worldwide distribution. Data East itself released the game in North America, and contracted Sony Imagesoft for the game's distribution in Europe.\r\nThe Mega Drive version of the game was re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console service in Europe and Australia on March 22, 2008 and on April 14, 2008 in North America.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>Mega银河战士</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32911\">Data East</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Turrican III: Payment Day</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Turrican 3</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii VC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年</li><li><span>开发: </span>Factor 5</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"amiga","count":1},{"name":"RNG","count":1},{"name":"MD","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":32911,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/89/85/32911_prsn_IIwV7.jpg","name":"Data East","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":252426,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0e/d8/252426_AnA2p.jpg","title":"Turrican II: The Final Fight","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/252426"}]}
