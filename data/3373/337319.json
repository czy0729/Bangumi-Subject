Six people are grouped in front of a wall as if for a photograph. The entire ceremony is supervised by a seventh person, who, like a photographer, looks at the group from different angles and rearranges the group by hand-signals.\r\nThe picture is perfect. The camera shifts position and discloses a squad of soldiers with rifles at the ready; rifles aimed at the group of six. Volley of shots. Fade out. The End.\r\n\r\n","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>仪式</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>*1965年</li><li><span>片长: </span>3分26秒</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
