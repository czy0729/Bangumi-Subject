Aaliyah’s new case also has a connection to a 14-year-old case in New Orleans that was investigated by FBI agent Francis York Morgan, the protagonist of the first game. Players will control both characters, it seems, as their stories intersect and reveal clues about each other’s cases.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>致命预感2</li><li><span>别名: </span>Deadly Premonition 2</li><li><span>平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Survival horror</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2020年7月10日</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"NS","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":77020,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/29/c5/77020_l16c9.jpg","title":"RedSeedsProfile","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/77020"}]}
