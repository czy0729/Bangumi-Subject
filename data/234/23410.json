Marshall gets a job in environmental law. Barney proves to Nora that he can be a good boyfriend to her, while Robin is revealed to still have feelings for Barney. Robin takes court-mandated therapy, until her therapist Kevin (Kal Penn) says he finds her attractive and therefore cannot be her therapist anymore. They start to date.\r\nWhile reminiscing about Hurricane Irene, Barney and Robin end up sleeping together. Barney and Robin both realize what they've done and decide to break up with their partners. However, Robin decides to stay with Kevin, which devastates Barney, who did break up with Nora. Marshall and Lily decide they want to move to Long Island, after Lily's paternal grandparents offer them their house there.\r\nRobin gets a pregnancy scare. Going to the doctor, she learns that she cannot have children, which devastates her. Kevin proposes to Robin, while she knows she loves him and that she is ready for the commitment, she tells him she can't have children and that she doesn't want kids at all, so they break up. Soon after, Robin tells everything that happened to Ted, only for him to profess his love for her (which is revealed to be the final time he declares his love for someone other than his future wife). Robin soon admits that she does not love Ted, and Marshall asks her to move out of Ted's apartment so that Ted can finally move on in his love life. Ted then gives his apartment back to Lily and Marshall, because he feels he and Robin haunt that place.\r\nBarney starts dating a stripper called Quinn. Soon it is decided that Quinn will move in with Barney, and Ted moves into Quinn's place. Soon after this, Robin is asked to deliver a traffic report from the World Wide News helicopter. However, the pilot suffers a stroke which forces her to land the helicopter herself with assistance from the ground. The whole incident is broadcast live and everyone in New York watches, making Robin an instant celebrity. Barney asks Quinn to give up job of a stripper, however Quinn doesn't want to, telling him she likes being a stripper.\r\nLily, worried that Marshall is too stressed with the birth close at hand, tricks Marshall with the help of Barney, who takes Marshall to a casino, where Marshall gets too drunk. Meanwhile, Ted decides to patch up his differences with Robin. Lily goes into labor, calling Barney and Marshall to get back to New York, however Marshall is still in the casino, drunk and his phone has been turned off. After many attempts to escape the casino, Marshall comes in time for Lily's delivery. Because of Marshall's promise with Barney, Marshall and Lily name their son Marvin \"Wait For It\" Ericksen. In the season finale, Marshall and Lily begin their new family with their baby. Barney proposes to Quinn after she tells him that she quit her job, and she accepts. Ted, after his conversation with Robin about his love life, calls Victoria to see if he still has a chance with her, even though she is getting married. She leaves her fiancé for Ted and wants to go off into the sunset with him. Ted eventually decides to go with her.\r\nThe season ends with a flash forward to Barney's wedding, where the bride is revealed to be Robin.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>老爸老妈的浪漫史
