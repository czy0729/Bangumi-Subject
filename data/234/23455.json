It was designed as a means to prevent another 9/11-type disaster, but Finch discovered that it was also predicting many \"irrelevant\" (non-terrorist) crimes. The non-terrorist data is dumped to a separate database and deleted each night. Finch realized that a great many domestic crimes could also be prevented if that data could be used. Finch built a backdoor into the machine that allows him to retrieve a list of Social Security numbers of people who will be involved in those crimes in order of occurrence. Unable to investigate the data on his own, Finch hires John Reese (Jim Caviezel), a former Green Beret and CIA field officer who is presumed dead, to help stop the crimes from taking place. The world thinks that Finch, like Reese, is dead. Finch made the choice of only transmitting the Social Security Numbers of the persons of interest so that if the backdoor is discovered, the government would have no clue as to what the numbers mean or that Finch is still alive.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>疑犯追踪 第一季</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>4</li><li><span>制片人/制作人: </span><a href=\"/person/5758\">J.

After this, he is extracted from police custody before Homicide Detective Joss Carter (Taraji P. Henson) can confront him about links to previous killings discovered through fingerprint analysis. Reese is brought to a mysterious and somewhat secretive billionaire, Harold Finch (Michael Emerson), who is the creator of the next-generation software known simply as \"The Machine\". After 9/11, Finch developed a computer program that can sift through enormous amounts of data, looking for patterns of behavior or activity that would predict another attack. It also provides information about individuals who could be in danger; it can predict the identity of a person involved in a premeditated crime that will happen at some point in the future—however, Finch's back-door link to The Machine only provides the Social Security number of the person, and offers no clues to their involvement or when the crime will take place. Finch, who feels a need to do something to help these people, enlists Reese to aid him in preventing these crimes, hoping that it will give Reese a purpose following the death of his girlfriend, Jessica (Susan Misner). A reluctant Reese agrees to watch the first person on his list, Diane Hansen (Natalie Zea), an Assistant District Attorney currently working on a major prosecution concerning a prominent drug killing. Reese soon learns that Hansen is not the victim, but the perpetrator running a ring of corrupt police officers and planning to kill a fellow DA, Wheeler (Brian d'Arcy James). After blackmailing one of the corrupt officers, Detective Lionel Fusco (Kevin Chapman), into being his source of information inside the NYPD, Reese reveals Hansen's corruption to an open court, kills the corrupt Detective Stills (James Hanlon), and links Fusco to the crime to ensure his future cooperation.

Reese works with the team as a rookie as Finch tracks the car in an attempt to predict the robbery. When the team picks up platinum valued at $1.25 million, the vehicle explodes and Reese is shot by Clay. Reese awakes in a hospital and is rescued by Carter. Finch tracks Clay to a motel, where his two partners in crime have been killed. Fusco arrives and realizes that HR is involved in the robbery as Finch finds Clay's partner, a waitress named Ashley (Virginia Kull). Reese finds Clay, and realizes that Clay is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim, just before Clay is killed by Ashley. Ashley leaves with the platinum, but is killed by Captain Arthur 'Artie' Lynch, a member of HR, who is in turn killed by Fusco coming to Reese's rescue. Meanwhile, in flashbacks shown throughout the episode, Reese, while on a mission with Kara Stanton in Morocco, receives a desperate-sounding phone-call from Jessica before he and Kara are ordered to travel to Ordos, China to retrieve a stolen computer. The orders are given in person by Mark Snow and a mysterious woman (Elizabeth Marvel)—revealed in episode 22 to have been Alicia Corwin of the NSC, Nathan Ingram's Government contact, therefore the implications are much larger—and their mission in China is shown as it played out. Reese is puzzled when Snow orders him to kill Kara, who has allegedly been compromised, when their mission is completed. When the time comes, however, Reese hesitates and is shot by Kara, who was given instructions identical to those given to Reese. Reese realizes that the CIA actually wants the computer destroyed and anyone who had access to it dead, including him and Kara, and escapes the building as an AC130 destroys it. In the present day, Snow and Evans follow a lead that they believe will lead to Reese. They arrive at a hotel, where Evans is killed and Snow is taken hostage by Kara, revealed to have survived the air strike.\r\n\r\nDirected by Kevin Bray\r\nWritten by Ray Utarnachitt","status":"Air"},{"id":131825,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/131825","type":0,"sort":21,"name":"Many Happy Returns","name_cn":"","duration":"00:44:01","airdate":"2012-05-03","comment":6,"desc":"Reese gets the day off, ostensibly for his birthday. Finch goes to Carter for help, but then urges her to accompany agent Donnelly to New Rochelle, where Donnelly suspects Reese in the disappearance of a man after his wife died in a car accident. Carter finds clues indicating the husband abused his wife, making her death suspicious. Finch works with Detective Fusco to find POI Karen Garner (Dagmara Dominczyk), pursued by U.S. Marshals for identity theft. But again the official story is debunked after Reese—rescuing the mission from the fumblings of Finch and Fusco—learns she is fleeing her abusive husband (Jeremy Davidson), a marshal who framed her to trigger the manhunt. As case parallels emerge, so does the identity of the dead wife in New Rochelle: Reese's ex-girlfriend, Jessica Arndt. Did Reese kill her husband? Will he kill the marshal? A phone call to Carter suggests Reese deposits his bad guys, with drugs he plants on them, at a Mexican prison. Reassured, Carter shreds a military file on Reese that arrives for Donnelly. In the final flashback, Reese, who's just learned of Jessica death, bumps into a man in a wheelchair. It's Finch, with a folder suggesting Jessica Arndt was a POI he could not save.\r\n\r\nDirected by Frederick E. O.

But it’s just a new POI: Henry Peck (Jacob Pitts), an NSA security analyst. Someone is after Peck for unwittingly pointing up the Machine in a security report. Flashback to 2009: Nathan Ingram’s government contact, Alicia Corwin, tells him, ominously, that the Machine will flag anyone who discovers its existence. It occurs to Ingram: The U.S. government might abuse its power to secretly spy on Americans. He asks Finch to create a contingency program. Finch deems it a dangerous plan, so Ingram does it himself. Peck meanwhile keeps getting rescued by (then escaping) Reese. Along the way, he ultimately realizes the Machine exists: \"Our own government is spying on us, and they want to kill me for covering it up! I have to tell someone!\" he yells during one of the rescue-escapes. Finch finally corners Peck while he’s waiting to meet a journalist. He gives Peck a new identity kit, admits to creating the machine, then walks away, unaware that Alicia Corwin overheard his admission. Reese tracks down Finch’s fiancée (Carrie Preston), and Finch later confirms that he faked his death to protect her.\r\n\r\nDirected by Stephen Williams\r\nWritten by David Slack","status":"Air"},{"id":163071,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/163071","type":0,"sort":23,"name":"Firewall","name_cn":"","duration":"00:44:00","airdate":"2012-05-17","comment":6,"desc":"Fusco is hired by HR leadership to obstruct any investigation into a planned murder, which happens to be the current POI: Caroline Turing, PhD (Amy Acker), a therapist with a powerful client list. To protect Turing, Reese signs up for therapy. After saving Turing from an assassin on a city street, he attempts to hide her at a hotel. But thanks to street surveillance footage, both HR and the FBI find them and converge on the building. Finch and the two detectives—who discover they’re on the same team—help Reese get Turing out. Later, Finch goes to meet Turing, but instead finds Alicia Corwin, who demands his help in shutting down the Machine. Then Turing arrives, wrapping up the plan that she—Root, the hacker from Root Cause—set into play in order to get answers about the Machine. Root kills Alicia and abducts Finch. Montage: Reese finds Corwin's body. Carter and Fusco disseminate damning evidence about HR, anonymously. Reese gazes into a surveillance camera and tells the Machine to help him find Finch.
