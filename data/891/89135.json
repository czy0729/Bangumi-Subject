While Mysterio escapes with a fragment, Madame Web appears and reveals to Spider-Man that 12 of the fragments have been scattered to three other realities across the multiverse, including the Noir, 2099, and Ultimate universes, each of them with their own unique Spider-Man. To restore balance to the multiverse, Madame Web also recruits Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Man 2099, and a black-suited Ultimate Spider-Man to retrieve the fragments from their respective worlds. After a short tutorial, each Spider-Man easily retrieves their first fragment and returns to Madame Web, who warns them that, even shattered, the tablet can grant great powers and thus must not fall into the wrong hands. Meanwhile, Mysterio discovers that his fragment has granted him real magic powers.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n《蜘蛛侠：破碎维度》游戏是一款以蜘蛛侠为题材的动作游戏，玩家在四个平行世界里，担任四位不同的蜘蛛侠打击罪犯。每位蜘蛛人都有各自不同的特殊能力与关卡设计，并且还能在打斗的过程中获得蜘蛛魂（Spider Emblems），用来解开更多招式花俏的连续攻击技。 值得一提的是，虽然每位蜘蛛侠身处的场景都设定在纽约市，但藉由不同时空的诠释与独树一格的场景风格，让玩家彻底体验到不同以往的蜘蛛侠题材游戏。","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>蜘蛛侠：破碎维度</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/34961\">Beenox</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17518\">Activision</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>スパイダーマン・シャタード ディメンション</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>XBOX 360</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>DS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>A-AVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2010-09-07</li>","collection":{"on_hold":1,"dropped":4,"wish":9,"collect":31,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"ACT","count":7},{"name":"2010","count":5},{"name":"","count":""}],"crt":[{"id":23102,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/1c/23/23102_crt_u0drA.jpg","name":"Spider-Man","desc":"主角"},{"id":133240,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/e4/87/133240_crt_sE2Wu.jpg","name":"Miguel O'Hara","desc":"配角"}],"staff":[{"id":17518,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/cb/6c/17518_prsn_bBbhR.jpg","name":"Activision","desc":"发行"},{"id":34961,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/af/11/34961_prsn_dk5H3.jpg","name":"Beenox","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":285541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/16/5a/285541_eXldO.jpg","title":"Spider Man: Edge of Time","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/285541"}]}
