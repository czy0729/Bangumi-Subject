Taking inspiration from George Romero's \"Of the Dead\" series, the mod is set during a time in which the world is on the verge of collapsing into chaos from a disease whose origin is unknown. Many experts and organizations have their theories and ideas on how such a disease emerged and started to systematically destroy our very way of life, but one fact is clear to all. Whoever perishes from the disease gets up and kills, and the people they killed get up and kill. \r\n\r\nThe chances of you surviving this all out war of society and the undead are slim to none. Already, there are millions of the walking dead shambling about, searching for food to eat. There's no known cure. One bite can possibly end it all for you. However, you aren't alone in this nightmare. There are still a handful of uninfected survivors left in this god forsaken hellhole, and with co-operation and teamwork, you may live long enough to fight your way to salvation.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>地狱已满</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":8,"dropped":3},"tags":[{"name":"硬核","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}]}
