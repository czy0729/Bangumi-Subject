As Konami's final shooting game for the Famicom, the game was developed to push the hardware's specifications to its limits and utilized Konami's custom VRC4 chip (previously used for the Famicom version of Gradius II) to allow for four-way scrolling and large bosses. However, because of the game's late release during the Famicom's lifespan, a year after the launch of its successor the Super Famicom, Crisis Force did not achieve the popularity that Konami expected.\r\nThe player controls one of two fighter ships piloted by Asuka and Maya, a pair of twin siblings descended from the ancient civilizations of Mu, who must save the world from a breed of artificial monsters from the lost civilization of Atlantis. The main feature of the game system is the player's ability to transform its ship in one of three different forms, each with its unique attack method.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>帝国战机</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>危机军队</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>危机武力</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>CrisisForce</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Crisis Force</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>纵版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1991年8月27日</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"FC","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":747,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/c1/747_prsn_43cah.jpg","name":"科乐美","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":314363,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/10/53/314363_jpzpD.jpg","title":"Konami Shooting Collection","type":"原声集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/314363"}]}
