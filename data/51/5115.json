Tipped in the top three of the BBC\\'s Sound of 2008 poll at the beginning of the year, seemingly they have much to prove. However, The Ting Tings aren\\'t about proving themselves; they are simply here to enjoy it. Making great British pop music - their way - is what they\\'re about.\r\n　　Born of a desire to employ the DIY ethic from day one - Katie White and Jules De Martino escaped the industry trappings they once experienced in a previous band and went back to basics as a duo. They stripped back everything they thought they both knew about making music and the industry that revolved around every note.\r\n　　We Started Nothing is a debut album brimming with intuitive pop noise. It\\'s pure garage-pop and once heard will in-bed itself into your subconscious for many days, weeks, months to come. Snappy choruses trade off against angular gutar work, whip smart drumming and a succession of loops that they create live with the use of delay pedals.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>白手起家</li><li><span>艺术家: </span>The Ting Tings</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>2008-05-19</li><li><span>价格: </span>$7.55</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>37.8分钟</li><li><span>发行商: </span>Phantom Sound & Vision</li><li><span>碟片数量: </span>1</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"插入歌","count":2},{"name":"twitter","count":1},{"name":"无法坦诚相对","count":1},{"name":"素直になれなくて","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Great Dj","href":"/ep/35395"},{"title":"2 That\\'s Not My Name","href":"/ep/35396"},{"title":"3 Fruit Machine","href":"/ep/35397"},{"title":"4 Traffic Light","href":"/ep/35398"},{"title":"5 Shut Up And Let Me Go","href":"/ep/35399"},{"title":"6 Keep Your Head","href":"/ep/35400"},{"title":"7 Be The One","href":"/ep/35401"},{"title":"8 We Walk","href":"/ep/35402"},{"title":"9 Impacilla Carpisung","href":"/ep/35403"},{"title":"10 We Started Nothing","href":"/ep/35404"}]}],"like":[{"id":925,"name":"星际牛仔原声集3 - BLUE","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/7f/a7/925_Tv4S1.jpg"},{"id":910,"name":"新世纪福音战士原声音乐 十周年纪念CD [DECADE]","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e2/05/910_965v9.jpg"},{"id":5931,"name":"FLY ME TO THE MOON","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/aa/1b/5931_jp.jpg"},{"id":4843,"name":"圣斗士星矢","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/02/24/4843_NvnwR.jpg"},{"id":5868,"name":"黑猫警长","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c4/1d/5868_5tEnL.jpg"},{"id":2463,"name":"无头骑士异闻录","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/18/43/2463_FGJkn.jpg"},{"id":265,"name":"新世纪福音战士","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e5/69/265_Z5Uou.jpg"}]}
