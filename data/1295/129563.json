The game is set in medieval fantasy setting and focuses primarily on strategic fighting using shield and sword.\r\n\r\nThe Sword Master is a knight who was summoned into a kingdom in order to defeat an evil wizard and powerful demon which he summoned. The game follows the knight as he marches through forest, village, and all around the enemy's castle, until both the wizard and the demon are destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe player must use sword and shield to battle through 7 game levels, from the forest, to a cursed town, to multiple levels of the villain's castle lair. The player encounters giant bats, wolves, skeleton warriors, evil knights, wizards, lizard men, gargoyles, and other fierce enemies on his quest. The Sword Master can swing his sword, defend with his shield, and gather power-ups which enable him to change his form.
