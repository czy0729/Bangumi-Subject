A group of prisoners are sentenced to certain death by exiling them to the secluded Mount Grimrock for vile crimes they may or may not have committed. Unbeknownst to their captors, the mountain is riddled with ancient tunnels, dungeons and tombs built by crumbled civilizations long perished now. If they ever wish to see daylight again and reclaim their freedom the ragtag group of prisoners must form a team and descend through the mountain, level by level.\r\n\r\nThe game brings back the oldschool challenge with highly tactical real-time combat and grid-based movement, devious hidden switches and secrets as well as deadly traps and horrible monsters. Legend of Grimrock puts an emphasis on puzzles and exploration and the wits and perception of the player are more important tools than even the sharpest of swords could be. And if you are a hardened dungeon crawling veteran and you crave an extra challenge, you can arm yourself with a stack of grid paper and turn on the Oldschool Mode which disables the luxury of the automap! Are you ready to venture forth and unravel the mysteries of Mount Grimrock?","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>魔岩山传说</li><li><span>平台: </span>Windows, Mac, Linux</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2012-04-12</li><li><span>售价: </span>$9.99 USD (on Steam) / $14.99 USD(official site and Gamersgate)</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.grimrock.net/</li><li><span>开发商: </span>Almost Human Games</li><li><span>出版商: </span>Almost Human Games</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":3,"doing":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"RPG","count":2},{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"DungeonCrawl","count":1},{"name":"IOS","count":1}]}
