Budokai 2 is a sequel to Dragon Ball Z: Budokai and was developed by Dimps and published by Atari for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube. It was released for the PlayStation 2 in North America on December 4, 2003, and on the Nintendo GameCube on December 15, 2004. The game was published in Japan by Bandai, and released for the PlayStation 2 on February 5, 2004.\r\nThe game's features include a tournament stage, versus mode, and an item shop. Unlike its predecessor, Budokai 2's story mode is known as Dragon World, which introduces a unique retelling of all four chapters of Z and plays like a board game as the player assembles a team of Z-fighters alongside Goku to challenge the various enemies from the story. The game has a total of 31 playable characters including fusions of different fighters, and Majin Buu's various absorbed forms, many of which were unique to Budokai 2 including an original fusion between Tien and Yamcha and Super Buu absorbing Vegeta, Frieza, Cell, and Tien and Yamcha simultaneously, which did not appear in future games. The Japanese version of the game added several new costumes, as well as a new stage in the game's story mode. Some of the added costumes were added to the North American release of the GameCube version.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>龙珠Z 武道会2</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32714\">ディンプス</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/18776\">バンダイ</a>（日本）、<a href=\"/person/17916\">Atari, Inc</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>龙珠二世2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>DRAGON BALL Z 2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>龙珠Z2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>DRAGON BALL Z2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>ドラゴンボールZ2V</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003年12月4日</li><li><span>售价: </span>168元</li><li><span>首发地区: </span>北美</li><li><span>其他发行日期: </span>2004年2月5日(PS2 日本、港台)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">其他发行日期: </span>2004年12月15日(NGC)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">其他发行日期: </span>2005年3月18日(PS2 中国大陆)</li><li><span>协力: </span>Pyramid, Inc.、Pole To Win Co., Ltd.</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"PS2","count":2},{"name":"龙珠Z2","count":1},{"name":"龙珠Z武道会2","count":1},{"name":"龙珠","count":1},{"name":"NGC","count":1},{"name":"FTG","count":1},{"name":"格斗","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":32714,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/91/52/32714_prsn_bbeQn.jpg","name":"Dimps","desc":"开发"},{"id":18776,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/4e/ad/18776_prsn_M5a5K.jpg","name":"万代","desc":"发行"},{"id":17916,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/57/6a/17916_prsn_FZygZ.jpg","name":"雅达利公司","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":293919,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c1/52/293919_u28bb.jpg","title":"ドラゴンボールZ","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/293919"},{"id":86803,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/87/da/86803_d42wJ.jpg","title":"ドラゴンボールZ3","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/86803"}]}
