She plans for her retirement and signs an exit agreement with her firm. She meets with friends to celebrate, including the Rindell family, headed by the powerful and respected Henry Rindell, a financial consultant who has invested money for many prominent businesspeople in Chicago, including Diane and many of her clients. Diane is the godmother to Rindell's daughter, Maia, who has just passed the bar, and through Diane's connections, has secured her a starting position at the firm. Diane heads what will be her final case at the firm, a police brutality charge, in which she is representing the state. Opposing her is Adrian Boseman, the head of a rival firm, hoping to secure a large settlement for his client. Boseman is assisted by Lucca Quinn, having joined Boseman's firm after leaving Diane's employ.\r\n\r\nBefore Diane can close the case, Henry Rindell is arrested for orchestrating an elaborate ponzi scheme, and Diane finds herself broke and unable to follow through with her retirement. However, when she attempts to return to the firm, she is rebuffed. Joining another firm also proves difficult, as Diane is seen as complicit in the scam, having directed many of her clients to invest with Rindell. Diane is told that her assets may be seized as evidence, and she is advised to divorce her husband, Kurt, to prevent his assets being seized as well. Having separated from Kurt after the discovery of his affair, Diane brings up the option to him, but he refuses to file for divorce, still hoping for a reconciliation. Meanwhile, Boseman realizes that there is an opportunity to gain Diane's services for a fraction of her value, and he offers her a junior partner position at his firm. With few other options, Diane accepts Boseman's offer, and when Maia is fired, in part due to her father's financial scandal, Diane brings her along to her new firm."},{"id":700831,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/700831","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"First Week","duration":"00:52:35","airdate":"2017-02-19","comment":0,"desc":"Maia Rindell arrives at her new firm trying to ignore multiple anonymous calls and texts from angry clients of her father, who swear revenge for the money he stole from them. She meets Julius Cain, a managing partner, and Lucca Quinn, a third year associate. Cain brings all the lower level associates to a local union headquarters to offer free legal advice as part of their retainer with the union. While there, Maia ends up taking the case of Frank Gwynn, a man who is unfairly having his wages garnished due to charges of theft from his place of work. During arbitration, Maia loses the case, but Lucca steps in to accuse the company of false imprisonment, as they had detained Frank for seven hours to question him about the theft. When the firm decides that the case is too small to invest resources in, Lucca proposes that they open a class action lawsuit against multiple companies who had garnished wages after accusing their employees of theft. Meanwhile, Diane moves into her new office, assisted by Marissa Gold, who has been demoted at Diane's old firm. Marissa decides to help with the class action in hopes of being hired as Diane's new assistant. She tracks down multiple employees who have had their wages garnished and adds them to the suit. Grateful, Diane accepts Marissa as her new secretary. However, at Frank's opening trial, the prosecution uncovers evidence that Frank had been involved in an earlier theft at a previous job, casting doubt on his story. Frank loses his case, and the loss causes the firm to pull out of the class action lawsuit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Diane is visited by Maia's mother, Lenore, who asks Diane to meet with her husband, Henry.
