Jane has been telling the girls about meeting celebrities by slipping one's phone into their pockets; believing the dropped phone to be Sally's, Jane puts it Frostrup's pocket with the intention of reclaiming the \"lost\" phone. This causes confusion when Susan calls the number during the dinner. Additionally, a misunderstanding over the term 'Whistling alone,' which Steve assumes to be a euphemism for masturbation, causes him to order Susan's parents out of the flat. Meanwhile, Jeff and Patrick learn that one of Patrick's former lovers made a cast of his endowment, which is now a best-selling sex toy called the \"Junior Patrick.\" Steve is enlisted to procure a specimen, which he accidentally gifts to Susan's parents.

However, she loses control of Jake, who expresses her honest opinions of everyone... including her boss (Shaughan Seymour), lately arrived to offer her job back to her.

At the pub, Patrick trips over the mother of an old flame, who seduced him, and attempts to sneak past her; however, when it turns out that she does not remember him at all, he charges back in to restore his (perceptions of) virility. Susan consults Jane for tips on keeping Steve's interest, but mostly learns that Jane likes to troll Steve by prank-calling him in silence. Steve makes arrangements for Jeff to call him during the date with claims of familial disaster. However, the disruptive phone call actually comes from... Susan, who, by pretending to be a silent Jane, gets Steve to confess that he wants to marry her.

After chewing out Giselle in fluent French, a man starts hitting on her, mistaking her nationality, and Susan goes along with it instead of setting him straight. She then discovers her mobile phone has lost all its numbers. Attempting to phone Steve in her French accent, she accidentally calls Bruce's Bar and Grill, run by the Australian Dick Darlington. He informs her that his establishment is located next to \"Susan's Bar,\" named after an Englishwoman who slept her way across the continent due to her great love of Australians. Susan, believing herself to be said woman, is mortified. The episode then flashes back to view Steve's day, in which he gives his number to a girl at the bar by mistake. To avoid her, he fabricates \"Bruce's Bar and Grill\" and his identity as Dick Darlington, and is completely fooled by Susan's accent.\r\n\r\nThe episode then flashes back again to earlier that morning, with Julia complaining about Giselle to Jeff, and then calling his mobile in a flirty French accent. However, she accidentally reaches Susan - she and Jeff have identical mobile phones, and they swapped without knowing it at some prior point (thus Susan's missing contacts) - and presents herself as Giselle, leading to Susan's furious rant and the encounter with the other man. After Susan has returned to Steve's place, Steve begs Jeff to claim to be Dick Darlington, while Julia arrives and proclaims herself Giselle. The chain of mistaken identity is broken only when the girl from the bar calls. Everybody hears her conversation with Steve on speakerphone, and Susan, realizing that both she and Steve feel trapped by their life together, decides to leave. \"Where are you going,\" Steve asks her; she replies, \"It's up to you.\"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":9276,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f8/89/9276_Izkd8.jpg","title":"Coupling Season 1","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/9276"},{"id":9278,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a5/54/9278_s5RRP.jpg","title":"Coupling Season 3","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/9278"}],"like":[{"id":9279,"name":"冤家成双对 第四季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/fc/1c/9279_ys0DY.jpg"},{"id":9276,"name":"冤家成双对 第一季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f8/89/9276_Izkd8.jpg"},{"id":9278,"name":"冤家成双对 第三季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a5/54/9278_s5RRP.jpg"},{"id":6841,"name":"IT狂人 第四季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/95/59/6841_Dw2DZ.jpg"},{"id":6793,"name":"IT狂人 第三季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f5/e5/6793_21rMN.jpg"},{"id":6792,"name":"IT狂人 第二季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5e/98/6792_mS71B.jpg"},{"id":6791,"name":"IT狂人 第一季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/35/b5/6791_akx31.jpg"},{"id":2564,"name":"欺诈游戏","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/81/69/2564_8xcVy.jpg"}]}
