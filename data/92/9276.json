Before dinner, Jeff and Patrick let slip that they know about the Inferno tape and Sally gives away that Susan has told the girls too, making dinner a very uncomfortable occasion for all. Patrick believes Jill and Jane are a couple and tries to convert her; on the other hand, Jill thinks Patrick is gay, due to his haircut, and tries to convert him, ending with the two in bed together.

When Steve and Susan independently learn about the cupboard, both realise that, as Patrick’s ex, Susan will be in there too. Susan catches the guys and Sally watching the tape, and is offended to learn that: they went behind her back on this matter; Patrick was so unimpressed with her performance that he taped over her; and none of the viewers noticed this.
