The player must help recharge Chip – a plucky little red robot – who has been imprisoned by the nefarious villain, Rust.\r\n\r\nThe player will interact with a wide variety of objects such as cannons, mirrors, and magnets in order to direct a blob of energy to Chip and save him from his grisly fate! Players must utilise their whimsical puzzle-solving prowess by tapping, moving, and rotating these objects to achieve victory.\r\n\r\nAs the player progresses through the game they will find presents hidden amongst the many puzzles in Rust’s lair, containing a variety of Rust’s fancy dress costumes. These can be used to customise your little robot avatar, for bragging rights on the leaderboard and because everybody loves a new pair of fuzzy slippers!","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>芯片</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>25 Apr, 2014</li><li><span>售价: </span>$6.99 USD</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://coatsink.com/games/chip</li><li><span>开发: </span>Coatsink</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"on_hold":1}}
