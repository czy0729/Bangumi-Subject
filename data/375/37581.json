The man is about to shoot again until a sound is heard and the roof crashes in on him. What caused that was Shinji fighting the Eva series, saving Kaji accidentally. Shinji keeps fighting as the JSSDF invades farther into Nerv. Misato commands the other pilots to be transferred to the lowest floor of Dogma. Gendo is down where the Reiquarium is and presses the button that destroyed all the Dummy Plug Plant Reis. He tells Ritsuko it was necessary to pull the lines. It is meaningless if there is only one line and he will trust the result of that path. Rei is in her room looking at Gendo's broken glasses and Asuka and Shinji's wedding invitation. Kaji walks in and tell Rei she needs to come to Nerv with Asuka for her safety. Kaji says he needs to pick up Toji and well and asks Rei if she has another plan and she says she does.","info":"<li><span>出版社: </span>スタジオKIMIGABUCHI</li><li><span>作画: </span>KIMIMARU</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2006年8月11日</li><li><span>页数: </span>206</li>","collection":{"collect":19},"tags":[{"name":"KIMIMARU","count":2},{"name":"漫画","count":2},{"name":"EVA","count":2},{"name":"2006","count":1},{"name":"コミックス","count":1},{"name":"同人","count":1},{"name":"RE-TAKE","count":1},{"name":"日本","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":37583,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e0/d9/37583_85di5.jpg","title":"RE-TAKE","type":"系列","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/37583"}],"lock":"条目已锁定"}
