Invitations have been sent to nobles and royals from all neighboring nations, although Charming and her parents only really care about the princes. After all, everyone knows that the true purpose of the ball is for Charming to find a man suitable as her husband so that she can form an advantageous political alliance, or even merge their nations together to save her kingdom from poverty. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately?) for Charming, the princes may need to be rescued just as much as her kingdom does.\r\n\r\nChoose a lad in distress to save in this comedic retelling of three well-known fairy tales!","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>LadsinDistress</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Visual Novel</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2016-04-07</li><li><span>售价: </span>Free</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://ladsindistress.tumblr.com/characters</li><li><span>itch.io: </span>https://catfishcrew.itch.io/lads-in-distress</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"pc乙女","count":1},{"name":"乙女向","count":1}]}
