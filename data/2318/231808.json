Soon enough, she finds herself exactly where she had hoped to be, living happily with her husband and two children in the Upper West Side. A woman of her time, Midge is a cheerleader wife to a man who dreams of a stand-up comedy career, but her perfect life is turned upside down when her husband suddenly leaves her for another woman. Completely unprepared, Midge is left with no choice but to reevaluate what to do with her life. When she accidentally stumbles onto the stage at a comedy club, she soon discovers her own comedic skills and decides to use this newfound talent to help her rebuild a different life for herself. The series will trace the trajectory of Midge's journey as she goes on to pursue a career in the male-dominated, stand-up comedy profession, and transforms from uptown housewife to East Village club performer.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>了不起的麦瑟尔女士</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>星期三</li><li><span>配角: </span><a href=\"/person/41875\">Jane Lynch</a></li><li><span>集数: </span>8</li><li><span>开始: </span>2017年11月29日</li><li><span>类型: </span>剧情 / 喜剧</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt5788792</li><li><span>在线播放平台: </span>Amazon</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Amy Sherman-Palladino</li><li><span>导演: </span>Rachel Brosnahan, Alex Borstein, Michael Zegen</li>","collection":{"on_hold":6,"dropped":4,"wish":11,"collect":69,"doing":5},"tags":[{"name":"美剧","count":19},{"name":"2017","count":8},{"name":"脱口秀","count":5},{"name":"搞笑","count":5},{"name":"Amazon","count":3},{"name":"艾美奖","count":3},{"name":"喜剧","count":2},{"name":"剧情","count":2},{"name":"了不起的麦瑟尔夫人","count":1},{"name":"相声","count":1},{"name":"精致女孩","count":1},{"name":"女神","count":1},{"name":"英美剧","count":1},{"name":"「美劇」´","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":763013,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/763013","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Pilot","duration":"00:56:52","airdate":"2017-03-17","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":763014,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/763014","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Ya Shivu v Bolshom Dome Na Kholme","duration":"00:51:32","airdate":"2017-11-29","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":763015,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/763015","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Because You Left","duration":"00:49:05","airdate":"2017-11-29","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":763016,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/763016","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"The Disappointment of the Dionne Quintuplets","duration":"00:55:04","airdate":"2017-11-29","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":763017,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/763017","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Doink","duration":"00:47:29","airdate":"2017-11-29","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":763018,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/763018","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Mrs. X at the Gaslight","duration":"00:46:44","airdate":"2017-11-29","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":763019,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/763019","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Put That On Your Plate!","duration":"00:51:08","airdate":"2017-11-29","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":763020,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/763020","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Thank You and Good Night","duration":"01:01:35","airdate":"2017-11-29","comment":0,"desc":""}],"staff":[{"id":41875,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/31/19/41875_prsn_MZ039.jpg","name":"Jane Lynch","desc":"配角"}],"relations":[{"id":234875,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/25/84/234875_8FFZp.jpg","title":"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Season 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/234875"}]}
