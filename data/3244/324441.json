Released for the Nintendo DS sometime in 2010 internally within the Japanese division of McDonald's, it was only ever distributed to the company's own restaurants domestically and never released to the public.\r\n\r\nThe game teaches the player to make hamburgers and do various other tasks in a McDonald's restaurant and was used to train new restaurant employees. It features several game modes and features, including simulations of food preparation and customer interaction, quizzes, player profiles for employees and managers, and performance statistics. It was distributed in tandem with a separate game titled eSMART which aimed to train preexisting employees rather than new ones.\r\n\r\nThe game had a budget of ¥200 million and was planned for use in all 3,700 McDonald's locations across Japan by the end of 2010,[1][2][3][4] to which it was distributed together with two McDonald's-skinned Nintendo DSis.[5] It is unknown to which extent it was used and for how long.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>麦当劳NDS员工培训</li><li><span>英文名: </span>eCrew Development Program</li><li><span>别名: </span>McDonald's Training Game</li><li><span>又名: </span>McDonald's eCDP</li><li><span>平台: </span>NDS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SIM; EDG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2010年</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1}}
