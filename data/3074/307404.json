It was released on 15 April 2014 in North America, and 17 April 2014 in Europe, as was the case with the 2010 edition.\r\n\r\nThe game's campaign mode, Road to Rio de Janeiro, allows players to play through qualification and the actual FIFA World Cup. For only the third time in the history of World Cup video games, the entire qualification series will be playable. The 2010 version only presented the UEFA and CONMEBOL groups in their true to life form. Another mode, Road to Rio de Janeiro, will allow players to compete in an online tournament across the 12 venues of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. It is similar in format to Seasons in FIFA 14 and Expedition mode from UEFA Euro 2012.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>FIFA巴西世界杯2014</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a> (EA Canada)</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2014年4月15日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://web.archive.org/web/20140221095058/http://www.easports.com/2014-fifa-world-cup</li><li><span>其他发行日期: </span>2014年4月17日 (欧洲)</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"艺电","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":307403,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e4/37/307403_S4373.jpg","title":"2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/307403"},{"id":208476,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4e/38/208476_o1m16.jpg","title":"FIFA 18","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/208476"},{"id":99835,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a7/74/99835_V86Ww.jpg","title":"FIFA 14","type":"主线故事","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/99835"}]}
