{"id":307431,"type":4,"name":"FIFA Street","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/17/2c/307431_C8ckT.jpg","summary":"The game is a spin-off of EA's FIFA series of football games, following the same formula as their other \"Street\" titles, NFL Street and NBA Street, by reducing the more complete version of the game into a simpler arcade style game. It focuses on flair, style and trickery, as opposed to what FIFA Football focuses on team play and tactics, reflecting the culture of freestyle football played in the streets and backlots across the world.\r\n\r\nUsing reputation and respect gained from playing 4-on-4 games with tricks and flair, the aim of FIFA Street is to build a team up of well-known and recognised players including Ronaldo and Ronaldinho to progress through street venues across the world.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>FIFA街球（2005）</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a> (EA Canada)</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2005年2月22日</li><li><span>其他发行日期: </span>2005年3月11日 (PAL)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">其他发行日期: </span>2005年7月21日 (日本)</li>","staff":[{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"艺电","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":307432,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5c/71/307432_Z24yo.jpg","title":"FIFA Street 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/307432"},{"id":307424,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ba/b4/307424_iXazx.jpg","title":"FIFA 06","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/307424"}]}
