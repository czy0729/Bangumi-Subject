Mike strikes a buyout deal, which Jesse phones Walter to discuss. Walter invites Jesse to his home to talk, and confides in Jesse his regret about selling out of Gray Matter for $5,000 and his plans to build another empire. When Skyler arrives, Walter insists Jesse dine with them. At dinner, Skyler reveals she knows that Walter told Marie about her affair with Ted Beneke. Talking after dinner, Walter tells Jesse that Skyler sent their children to live elsewhere and is waiting for his \"cancer to come back\", and that that he intends to continue cooking meth at all costs, because \"the business\" is all he has left."},{"id":186728,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/186728","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Say My Name","duration":"","airdate":"2012-08-26","comment":25,"desc":"Walter, Jesse and Mike meet with Declan, without the methylamine. Walter suggests that he cook for them, while they take a 35% cut and pay off the $5,000,000 to Mike. Jesse still wants to quit cooking meth after he has seen so much bloodshed and, after a dispute, Walter eventually lets him leave but is not willing to pay Jesse any of the \"dirty money\" he has earned. Meanwhile Hank has been told to end his pursuit of Mike, so instead he follows the lawyer, David, who is laundering Mike's money. David gives in to the DEA, but Walter finds out and warns Mike, who tells him to get the emergency getaway bag he left at the airport. When they meet, Walter demands that Mike tell him the names of the nine people in prison whose silence Mike has been paying for. Mike refuses to meet Walt's demand, so Walter shoots him using a gun he found in Mike's bag. Mike appears to escape, but Walt finds him. He then realizes aloud that he could have gotten the names from Lydia, and apologizes to Mike, who asks Walt to \"let him die in peace\". Within a few moments, Mike dies and falls to the ground."},{"id":186729,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/186729","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Gliding Over All","duration":"","airdate":"2012-09-02","comment":16,"desc":"Walter meets with Lydia to obtain the names of Mike's people. Lydia (correctly) suspects that Walter will dispose of her once he obtains the names unless she becomes useful in another way, so she partners with him to expand his distribution overseas to the Czech Republic. Walter takes the names to Todd's uncle, who has ties with neo-Nazi gangs operating in the prisons. The nine prisoners, including at least one ready to flip for Hank, are killed. Walter's meth production runs profitably and uninhibited. Skyler makes another effort to convince Walter to give up meth production, and Walter, shaken by his murder of Mike and seeing an opportunity to reunite his family, relents. Walter pays back Jesse's cut of the methylamine sale, and apparently gives up on meth production for good. The Whites' children move back in, and the family seems to be in repair. During a lunch by the pool, Hank skims through Walter's copy of Leaves of Grass, left in in the bathroom. A note from Gale to Walter on the inside cover is addressed to W.W. Hank connects this to the initials from Gale's lab notebook, finally piecing together Heisenberg's true identity."},{"id":186730,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/186730","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Blood Money","duration":"","airdate":"2013-08-13","comment":14,"desc":""},{"id":186731,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/186731","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Buried","duration":"","airdate":"2013-08-18","comment":8,"desc":""},{"id":186732,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/186732","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Confessions","duration":"","airdate":"2013-08-25","comment":12,"desc":""},{"id":186733,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/186733","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Rabid Dog","duration":"","airdate":"2013-09-01","comment":11,"desc":""},{"id":186734,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/186734","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"To'hajiilee","duration":"","airdate":"2013-09-08","comment":16,"desc":""},{"id":186735,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/186735","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"Ozymandias","duration":"","airdate":"2013-09-15","comment":27,"desc":""},{"id":186736,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/186736","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"Granite State","duration":"","airdate":"2013-09-22","comment":10,"desc":""},{"id":186737,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/186737","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"Felina","duration":"","airdate":"2013-09-29","comment":18,"desc":""}],"staff":[{"id":24146,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/fe/ba/24146_prsn_UbH4C.jpg","name":"Jonathan Banks","desc":"主演"},{"id":24143,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/03/79/24143_prsn_xRTw6.jpg","name":"RJ Mitte","desc":"主演"},{"id":24137,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/a9/3e/24137_prsn_XZsrR.jpg","name":"Bryan Cranston","desc":"主演"},{"id":24142,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/a4/7c/24142_prsn_n7ogB.jpg","name":"Betsy Brandt","desc":"主演"},{"id":24139,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/c6/e5/24139_prsn_9j4b8.jpg","name":"Aaron Paul","desc":"主演"},{"id":24138,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/88/04/24138_prsn_UHh15.jpg","name":"Anna Gunn","desc":"主演"},{"id":24147,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/0f/06/24147_prsn_Wp5Vx.jpg","name":"Jesse Plemons","desc":"主演"},{"id":24148,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/7d/cb/24148_prsn_sxAZq.jpg","name":"Laura Fraser","desc":"主演"},{"id":24136,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/9f/43/24136_prsn_8xX57.jpg","name":"Vince Gilligan","desc":"编剧"},{"id":24156,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/51/69/24156_prsn_oJf11.jpg","name":"Michael Slovis","desc":"摄影"},{"id":24155,"image":"","name":"George Mastras","desc":"故事"},{"id":24155,"image":"","name":"George Mastras","desc":"制片人/制作人"},{"id":24154,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/72/26/24154_prsn_d7YDY.jpg","name":"Peter Gould","desc":"制片人/制作人"},{"id":24149,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/01/18/24149_prsn_88b8e.jpg","name":"Dave Porter","desc":"音乐"},{"id":24140,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/fd/8e/24140_prsn_Y8Vp2.jpg","name":"Dean Norris","desc":"主演"},{"id":24144,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/5c/05/24144_prsn_tzh9U.jpg","name":"Bob Odenkirk","desc":"主演"},{"id":47246,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/93/0d/47246_prsn_KXX99.jpg","name":"Matt Jones","desc":"配角"},{"id":24136,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/9f/43/24136_prsn_8xX57.jpg","name":"Vince Gilligan","desc":"导演"},{"id":24136,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/9f/43/24136_prsn_8xX57.jpg","name":"Vince Gilligan","desc":"制片人/制作人"}],"relations":[{"id":20324,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f4/8f/20324_66WHX.jpg","title":"Breaking Bad (Season 4)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/20324"},{"id":293698,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/87/37/293698_Iycs9.jpg","title":"El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/293698"},{"id":372892,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/78/e7/372892_XrIqV.jpg","title":"Better Call Saul Season 6","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/372892"}],"like":[{"id":20324,"name":"绝命毒师 第四季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f4/8f/20324_66WHX.jpg"},{"id":25201,"name":"绝命毒师 第二季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/21/c3/25201_iFSV3.jpg"},{"id":46995,"name":"绝命毒师 第三季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6b/f4/46995_Zk76F.jpg"},{"id":102689,"name":"风骚律师 第一季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/29/82/102689_T438e.jpg"},{"id":5337,"name":"绝命毒师","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/80/73/5337_0saWw.jpg"},{"id":62024,"name":"权力的游戏 第三季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6b/83/62024_Z3idJ.jpg"},{"id":30310,"name":"黑镜 第一季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/11/b8/30310_gpS6r.jpg"},{"id":372892,"name":"风骚律师 第六季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/78/e7/372892_XrIqV.jpg"}]}
