It is a surreal horror game with a branching narrative. As a new D-Class transferred to Site-50, you must decide what you want to do as you navigate though the facility trying to survive various malicious SCP entities, determining what choices to make, and collecting pieces of the story to truly understand what is going on. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs you play, you can listen to Dr. Millar or Dr. Slate, each with their own motives and goals. Each choice and path you make effects the facility and playthrough, leading to many different possible endings. Each time you play, more of the story will be uncovered, and maybe the best choices aren’t the ones so obviously presented. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor quick action or fast rounds with friends, you can try the Survival Gamemode, where you are dropped in with the full facility to explore and escape from.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>恐怖</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019年8月9日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$19.99</li><li><span>开发商: </span>Mahelyk</li><li><span>发行: </span>None</li>","collection":{"wish":1}}
