The game features an open world environment, with elements of potential stealth gaming and reputation-based social mechanics, and is set during a fictitious multi-national military action in North Korea, circa 2007. The player takes control of one of three mercenary characters and completes contracts in the war-torn country for profit and to prevent a nuclear war. Critics gave favorable reviews to the game, in particular praising its focus on explosive mayhem.\r\n\r\nA sequel, Mercenaries 2: World in Flames, was released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Following Pandemic Studios' closure in November 2009, Electronic Arts announced Danger Close Games would be developing a second sequel, tentatively titled Mercs Inc. The game was eventually canceled following the closure of Danger Close Games in 2013.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32805\">Pandemic Studios</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32894\">LucasArts</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>雇佣兵：佣兵纪元</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Action-adventure</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Zero</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2005年1月11日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":32805,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/f1/86/32805_prsn_Ffyls.jpg","name":"Pandemic Studios","desc":"开发"},{"id":32894,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/68/8b/32894_prsn_2pRjR.jpg","name":"LucasArts","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":322985,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/fb/2e/322985_V1VHv.jpg","title":"Mercenaries 2: World in Flames","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/322985"}]}
