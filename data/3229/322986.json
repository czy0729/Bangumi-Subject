It was developed by High Moon Studios (formerly Sammy Studios) and published by Capcom in the United States and by Ubisoft in Europe and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe game mixes western, horror and steampunk genres, telling the story of Jericho Cross, an outlaw gunfighter in the late 19th-century American Frontier who has been turned into a vampire and forcibly recruited by the titular monster-hunting secret organization to fight against supernatural forces.\r\n\r\nDarkwatch was met with a generally positive critical reception, acclaimed in particular for its relatively unique Weird West setting and artistic merits. The game was accompanied by an extensive promotional campaign and was planned to be the first installment of a new media franchise, but its sequel got canceled in 2007 and the film adaptation remains in development hell.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/40459\">High Moon Studios</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Darkwatch: Curse of the West</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>黑暗守护者</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>黑暗标靶</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2005年8月16日</li>","staff":[{"id":40459,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/8a/14/40459_prsn_A7Ii7.jpg","name":"High Moon Studios","desc":"开发"},{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"发行"}]}
