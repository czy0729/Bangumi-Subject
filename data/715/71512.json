The game uses the same engine as Yuke's 2003 release WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain. Rumble Roses was followed by Rumble Roses XX, released for the Xbox 360 in 2006.\r\n\r\nThe Rumble Roses game featured only female wrestling characters, each with both a good (Face) and bad (Heel) persona for players to choose from; the only limitation was that the good and bad version of the same character could not fight each other. The game featured 11 playable characters, each with two versions of the same character. The game received only lukewarm reviews, with most commending it for its graphics but being less impressed with the audio quality, game play and storyline.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>搏击玫瑰</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ランブルローズ</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Sports (FTG)</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2004年11月9日</li><li><span>开发: </span>ユークス</li>","collection":{"collect":4},"tags":[{"name":"PS2","count":2}],"staff":[{"id":747,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/c1/747_prsn_43cah.jpg","name":"科乐美","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":646,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0f/f3/646_099DP.jpg","title":"Rumble Roses XX","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/646"}]}
