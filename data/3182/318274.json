The game, which has been available for Insiders since late February, is now available for everyone to play in the latest Stable channel release. Download the new Microsoft Edge here to get started surfing today!\r\n\r\nInspired by the classic Windows game SkiFree, the surf game challenges players to ride through the water while avoiding islands, fellow surfers, and other obstacles. Watch out for the kraken! Players can also collect hearts to extend their lives and boosts for a burst of speed. Surf as far as possible in an endless ocean, compete for the shortest time, or zig zag through as many gates as you can in a row. With three distinct game modes, players have a variety of ways to pass the time.\r\n\r\nTo catch the wave, simply navigate to edge://surf in the address bar. If you are not connected to the internet, Microsoft Edge will also provide a handy link to the game to help you pass the time.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>让我们网上冲浪吧</li><li><span>别名: </span>surf game edge</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Let’s surf</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>You're not connected</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Microsoft Edge SURF Game</li><li><span>平台: </span>Edge</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Webkit</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2020年5月21日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/05/26/surf-game-edge-stable/</li>","collection":{"collect":4}}
