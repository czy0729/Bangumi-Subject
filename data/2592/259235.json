{"id":259235,"type":4,"name":"The Adventures of Batman & Robin","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/18/8c/259235_RArAh.jpg","summary":"The Genesis version, developed by Clockwork Tortoise and published by Sega, is a run 'n' gun where both Batman and Robin must stop Mr. Freeze, who plans to freeze Gotham City. In order to keep the duo busy, he also frees the Joker, Two-Face and the Mad Hatter, each one with their own agenda. The Joker celebrates his birthday wreaking havoc in Gotham and stealing diamonds, Two-Face tries to take over the city from above, and Mad Hatter is creating a robot army in his surreal lair.\r\nThe game can be played by two players simultaneously; one player with Batman, and the other with Robin. Both characters are identical in terms of playability, and both use batarangs, bolas, or shuriken in long-range attacks, while using melee attacks at short range. There are four levels consisting of several stages, mostly of a straight left-to-right traverse to the end where the boss awaits. In some levels the game switches to a side-scrolling shooter, in which the players must control the Batwings.\r\nThe game features a dark electronica-styled soundtrack by Jesper Kyd.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>蝙蝠侠与罗宾历险记</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>蝙蝠侠和罗宾的冒险</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>蝙蝠侠和罗宾MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>The Adventures of Batman & Robin (Mega Drive)</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Run and gun</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995年</li><li><span>开发: </span>Clockwork Tortoise</li>","staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":256942,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4b/fb/256942_auUgo.jpg","title":"The Adventures of Batman & Robin","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/256942"}]}
