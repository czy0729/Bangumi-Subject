It is a Mega Drive exclusive — a completely different title from the Master System game with the same name despite both being developed by Compile. It is a platformer which stars the Ghostbusters Peter, Ray and Egon, though for some reason omits Winston.\r\nDuring development it appears the game was known as Ghostbusters II.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>捉鬼敢死队</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32942\">コンパイル</a>、<a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ゴーストバスターズ</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1990年6月30日</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"MD","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"开发"},{"id":32942,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5a/9e/32942_prsn_MIk3k.jpg","name":"Compile","desc":"开发"}]}
