As the sun starts to set beneath ruby-red clouds, the boy, Noël, happens upon a desolate cross-bridge atop a river of blood. Upon crossing over it, he finds himself standing by a gate wrought from stone.\r\n\r\nConfronted by the fantasies his beloved grandmother read to him as a child, the boy finds himself lost in a dark 'Wonderland.' However, all is not that it seems.\r\n\r\nWhile exploring, Noël must gather the memories of those forsaken souls who roam lest their hearts shatter.
