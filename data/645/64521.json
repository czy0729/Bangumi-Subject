R. Martin. In some areas the paperback edition was published in two parts titled Dreams and Dust and After the Feast.\r\nA Dance with Dragons was originally intended to be the title of the second novel in the sequence, when Martin still envisioned the series as a trilogy. Some early US editions of A Game of Thrones (1996) list A Dance of Dragons as the forthcoming second volume in the series. The 1998 anthology Legends, which features the novella The Hedge Knight from the same universe, lists A Dance of Dragons as the fifth installment of the series. Like the previous four volumes in the Ice and Fire series, the book includes a lengthy appendix, with the volume running a total of 1,040 pages.\r\n","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>魔龙的狂舞</li><li><span>册数: </span>1</li><li><span>作者: </span><a href=\"/person/7588\">George R.
