{"id":49565,"type":6,"name":"Weeds: Season 2","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/7b/89/49565_ne544.jpg","rating":{"total":2,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":1,"7":1,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0},"score":6.5},"summary":"The second season, while still comedic, has a much darker tone, as Nancy becomes increasingly involved in the more dangerous aspects of the drug world. In season 2, Silas is 16 years old while Shane is 11. Ignoring Heylia's advice, Nancy and Conrad start their own small-scale growing operation and eventually rent a suburban \"grow-house\" — a place where they can grow marijuana indoors using artificial light and hydroponics. She welcomes other people into her business, including her brother-in-law Andy and accountant (and customer) Doug. During this season, Peter Scottson tells Nancy he knows she is a drug dealer, but considers her too small time to be worth busting, and the two are married as part of a deal to legally protect Nancy from Peter testifying in a court of law. While Nancy's drug activities increase, Celia runs for, and wins, Doug's spot on the town council. Her victory is due to the incompetence of her husband Dean (a lawyer), who forgot to file Doug's paperwork, leaving him off the ballot. She immediately launches a drug-free campaign across Agrestic complete with drug-free zone signs and surveillance cameras. Doug and Celia share a strong desire for revenge on Dean, which inspires a brief sexual liaison.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>单身毒妈 第二季</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>1</li><li><span>集数: </span>12</li><li><span>开始: </span>2006-08-14</li><li><span>结束: </span>2006-10-30</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>30m</li><li><span>频道: </span>showtime</li>","collection":{"collect":3,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"Show","count":1},{"name":"美剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":198492,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/198492","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Corn Snake","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2006-08-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":198493,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/198493","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Cooking with Jesus","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2006-08-21","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":198494,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/198494","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Last Tango in Agrestic","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2006-08-28","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":198495,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/198495","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"A.K.A.
