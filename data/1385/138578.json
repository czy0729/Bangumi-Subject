Lovecraft's terrifying horror story gets an illustrated interpretation by one of today's finest graphic novel artists. Geologist William Dyer--the narrator of this novella--is desperate to stop a research team planning a journey to Antarctica. He himself led a disastrous mission there, only to discover evidence of blood-chilling evil from beyond Earth. Will the new expedition continue its plans? And what will happen if they go? Once again, as he did in \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" and \"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\" Ian N. J. Culbard has created an unforgettably powerful retelling of a classic tale.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>疯狂山脉</li><li><span>原作: </span><a href=\"/person/7589\">Howard Phillips Lovecraft</a></li><li><span>ISBN: </span>9781402780424</li><li><span>作者: </span>Culbard, Ian N.
