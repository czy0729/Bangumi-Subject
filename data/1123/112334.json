Disch. \r\n　　The film was based on the novel of the same name, written by Disch, which first appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1980. \r\n　　In 1988, it was the first animated film to be exhibited at the Sundance Film Festival, and the only one for 10 years until 1998's I Married a Strange Person. \r\n　　Two of the voice actors, Jon Lovitz (Radio) and Phil Hartman (Air Conditioner/Hanging Lamp), were then-current cast members of Saturday Night Live and guest stars for The Simpsons later on. Another, Thurl Ravenscroft (Kirby), was best remembered as the voice of Tony the Tiger, and some voice works on classic Disney films. \r\n　　Many members of Pixar Animation Studios were involved with this film, including John Lasseter, whose trademark A113 appears on Master's door, and Joe Ranft.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>电器小英雄</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>分镜: </span><a href=\"/person/40717\">Henry Selick</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>烤面包机</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>勇敢的小托斯特</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1987-07-10</li><li><span>片长: </span>90 分钟</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":3,"on_hold":1,"dropped":3},"tags":[{"name":"剧场版","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":912724,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/912724","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":40717,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/16/59/40717_prsn_5mAft.jpg","name":"亨利·塞利克","desc":"分镜"}],"relations":[{"id":112507,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a3/5f/112507_GVCBC.jpg","title":"The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/112507"},{"id":112510,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/cf/f0/112510_PLpL4.jpg","title":"The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/112510"}]}
