Alex is in seriously dumped condition. His friend Claude shows up to ask him to water the plants while he's out of town. He does and one time sees a man in the apartment across the street. When Claude gets back, Alex goes to see him, only to wind up framed for murder and on the run. A woman shopkeeper recognizes him, believes his story, and takes him to her place. The pair fall in love as Alex sleuths his own case. Things just might work out, but . . . Jason's tall, thin, expressionally limited, animal-headed figures seem downright Bogey-and-Baby-ish in this ever-so-satisfying, archetypal exercise in romantic fatalism.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>为什么你要这么做</li><li><span>出版社: </span>Fantagraphics</li><li><span>价格: </span>$12.95</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2005-06-17</li><li><span>页数: </span>48</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>1560976551</li><li><span>作者: </span>Jason</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"Jason","count":1},{"name":"其它","count":1},{"name":"欧美漫","count":1}]}
