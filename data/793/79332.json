Elevator Action Returns retains the elevator-based gimmick from the original, but expands the gameplay system and replaces the spy motif with a new scenario involving a paramilitary team fighting against a terrorist group.\r\nThe mostly well-received game was ported to the Sega Saturn and released as a Japan-only title named Elevator Action² Returns in 1997, and later included in Taito Legends 2 compilation release for the PlayStation 2, Windows and Xbox in 2006.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>电梯大战2</li><li><span>别名: </span>Elevator Action² Returns</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Elevator Action Returns</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Elevator Action II</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年 (ARC), 1997年2月14日 (SS)</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"1994","count":1},{"name":"TAITO","count":1},{"name":"ARCADE","count":1},{"name":"SS","count":1},{"name":"ARC","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":79330,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5e/60/79330_9S8Pp.jpg","title":"Elevator Action","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/79330"}]}
