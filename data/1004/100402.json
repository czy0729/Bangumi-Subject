A nearly naked man bolts from the trunk into the snowy woods nearby. In town, Lester Nygaard meets Sam Hess, a former high school bully, who causes him to break his nose after reacting to a fake punch. At the hospital, Nygaard and Malvo, suffering a head wound from the crash, sit beside each other. Nygaard relates the story to Malvo, who suggests killing Hess to prevent a future incident. Nygaard neither approves nor condemns the idea, but Malvo later kills Hess. Meanwhile, Chief Thurman and Officer Solverson investigate both the car wreck and Hess's death. They learn Nygaard spoke about Hess to someone at the hospital with injuries similar to those from the wreck. Thurman goes to question Nygaard, who has suddenly killed his psychologically abusive wife, Pearl, after years of being looked down on by his family and friends and has summoned Malvo to help with the aftermath. In the meantime, Thurman finds Pearl's corpse in the basement. Malvo arrives and kills Thurman, but not before the latter radios for help. Malvo is then seen going into the basement. Nygaard follows him a few moments later. However, in that time, Malvo mysteriously disappears. Feeling himself trapped, Nygaard intentionally knocks himself out to make the deaths look like a home invasion. In Duluth, Officer Gus Grimly appears talking to his daughter Greta on the police radio, as he sees a car speeding away. Grimly stops the driver who is revealed to be Lorne Malvo, who gives him two choices: press the issue and face death, or allow him to leave. Malvo leaves as Grimly confusedly gets back to his car.","status":"Air"},{"id":386289,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/386289","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"The Rooster Prince","name_cn":"","duration":"00:48:46","airdate":"2014-04-22","comment":1,"desc":"Mr. Numbers and Mr. Wrench arrive in Bemidji looking for Hess's killer.

Hers is Nygaard, whom she believes is connected to the frozen man at the car accident and the killings of Sam Hess, Pearl Nygaard, and Thurman. In Duluth, Malvo is hired to find out who is blackmailing Stavros Milos, the \"Supermarket King\" of Minnesota. Milos believes his soon-to-be ex-wife might be the culprit.

Meanwhile, Malvo informs Don Chumph, the fitness instructor of Stavros's wife, that he knows he is the blackmailer. Malvo insists on taking over the blackmail to further torment Stavros. To this end, he kills Stavros' beloved dog, replaces his back pain medication with adderall, and sabotages his plumbing system, causing pig blood to come out of his shower. On his daughter Greta's advice, Gus decides to come clean about letting Malvo off on his speeding ticket and drives to Bemidji to tell their police department.

Later, Lester tells Chief Oswalt a new story, claiming Chazz killed Pearl Nygaard during a heated lovers' quarrel. Lester also claims he was present when Chazz shot Chief Thurman, thus explaining his hand wound. He says he covered for his hot-headed brother only because he feared retaliation.

Meanwhile, Gus, who Lou told that Malvo could be in town, rushes to the police station to find Molly. On the way, he spots a vehicle that may be Malvo's in a driveway. He goes to investigate and after Malvo leaves, Gus enters the house. Malvo goes to a car dealership and asks the salesman to test drive a car he says looks like an \"undercover vehicle\". Back at the station, Lester is taken home by agents Pepper and Budge. Malvo follows them, appearing as the FBI backup that Pepper and Budge called for but who Malvo later called off. Lester goes inside, leaving Pepper and Budge on lookout. A car pulls in the driveway. Pepper and Budge, suspicious, pull their handguns and go to the driver's window. The driver is revealed to be the car salesman; Malvo then ambushes Pepper and Budge from behind, killing them both. Lester, now aware of Malvo's presence, runs upstairs to the bathroom and frantically dials 911. Malvo breaks in through the sliding glass doors and follows the sound of Lester's voice upstairs. Just when Malvo is about to ambush him, he steps on a bear trap Lester had put under some clothes. Lester jumps out of the bathroom and attempts to shoot Malvo, but misses. Malvo retreats back to his home and attempts to fix his badly fractured leg. He is interrupted by Gus, who proceeds to fire into Malvo's torso three times. This proves ineffective, as he is still very much alive, Gus fires two more rounds into Malvo's face, killing him. Molly and the police arrive at Malvo's hideout. Gus shows Molly a case filled with tape recordings, including Lester's call after he murdered Pearl. Two weeks later in Montana, Lester is snowmobile riding, but police ambush him.

She then joins Gus and Greta on the couch, where Gus tells her he received a citation for bravery but that she should be getting the credit. She assures him that it's his moment, as she gets to be police chief.","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":40610,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/dd/f2/40610_prsn_bulPL.jpg","name":"马丁·弗瑞曼","desc":"主演"}],"relations":[{"id":121589,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/45/02/121589_cks5x.jpg","title":"Fargo Season 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/121589"}]}
