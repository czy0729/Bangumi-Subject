It was released on April 14, 1987, in Japan and later that year in the United States for the NES. A European release came in 1990.\r\nThe main character, his weapon, and many of the enemies remain the same, but the gameplay of the NES version is quite different. While the arcade version is more of a standard side-scrolling action title, the NES's Rygar is an open-ended action-adventure game like Metroid (see Metroidvania), which was also released at the time. At the beginning of the game, Rygar has access to some of the worlds, but as the game progresses, new areas open up as the result of finding items such as the grappling hook, crossbow, and wind pulley, which lets him cross previously impassable obstacles.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>阿格斯战士</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/33279\">テクモ</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/33279\">テクモ</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>未来战士</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>阿尔戈斯战士</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Rygar</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Action-adventure</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人 (交互)</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1987年4月17日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"Platform","count":1},{"name":"Action-adventure","count":1},{"name":"FC","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":33279,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5b/e9/33279_prsn_MDpkY.jpg","name":"特库摩","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":79574,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/25/68/79574_IxISX.jpg","title":"Rygar - Legend Warrior","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/79574"}]}
