Developed by Tecmo, it was the first sports video game that was licensed by both the National Football League and the National Football League Players Association, thus allowing the game to use both the names and attributes of real NFL teams and real NFL players. Prior games used the real teams or the real players, but not both simultaneously. Although the game was released in late 1991, all team rosters and player attributes were based on the prior 1990–91 NFL season, which meant that no rookies taken in the 1991 NFL Draft and no player team changes executed before the start of the 1991 season were added.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>特库摩超级碗</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/33279\">テクモ</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/33279\">テクモ</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>特库摩超级美式足球</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Tecmo超级碗大赛</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>テクモスーパーボール</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1991年12月13日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"SPG","count":1},{"name":"FC","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":33279,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5b/e9/33279_prsn_MDpkY.jpg","name":"特库摩","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":260858,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/66/cd/260858_rIZDZ.jpg","title":"テクモボウル","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/260858"}]}
