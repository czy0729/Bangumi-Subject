It is based on the Japanese Eggerland video game series. It was the third and final installment of the Adventures of Lolo series released in the U.S. New gameplay elements were added to make the base gameplay deeper than before. However, in 1994, a game titled \"Adventures of Lolo\" was released for Game Boy in Europe (and Japan). Said Game Boy release was not the same game as the original NES release of the same name, but rather a fourth sequel in the series with continued additions to the base gameplay.\r\nIn Japan, this game was released as The Adventures of Lolo 2 because Adventures of Lolo was not released in Japan. Additionally, the Japanese version of the game had a different difficulty curve, different stages, and Moby (the whale-like creature) appeared in Level 9 instead of Level 11.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>罗罗大冒险2</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/6765\">HAL研究所</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/6765\">HAL研究所</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>罗罗大冒险3(美版)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Adventures of Lolo II</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Adventures of Lolo 3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>アドベンチャーズ オブ ロロ II</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1990年12月26日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"PUZ","count":1},{"name":"FC","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":6765,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/63/42/6765_prsn_uZVUv.jpg","name":"HAL研究所有限公司","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":259699,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/09/bd/259699_7BW90.jpg","title":"アドベンチャーズ オブ ロロ","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/259699"}]}
