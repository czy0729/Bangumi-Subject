It follows teenage protagonist Dave Miller as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend from a mad scientist, whose mind has been enslaved by a sentient meteor. The player uses a point-and-click interface to guide Dave and two of his six playable friends through the scientist's mansion while solving puzzles and avoiding dangers. Gameplay is non-linear, and the game must be completed in different ways based on the player's choice of characters. Initially released for the Commodore 64 and Apple II, Maniac Mansion was Lucasfilm Games' first self-published product.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>疯狂大楼</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32894\">LucasArts</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32894\">LucasArts</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/39902\">多和田吏</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>疯狂豪宅</li><li><span>平台: </span>Commodore 64</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Apple II</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>IBM PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari ST</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Graphic adventure</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1987年10月5日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"FC","count":1},{"name":"AVG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":32894,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/68/8b/32894_prsn_2pRjR.jpg","name":"LucasArts","desc":"开发"},{"id":39902,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/7c/04/39902_prsn_P8pk9.jpg","name":"多和田吏","desc":"音乐"}],"relations":[{"id":252367,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4d/d8/252367_TvMov.jpg","title":"Day of the Tentacle","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/252367"}]}
