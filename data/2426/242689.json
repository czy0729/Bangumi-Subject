In 2007, a version with enhanced graphics was released for the Wii. The game is not a direct adaptation of the 1983 film directed by Brian De Palma, but is instead an pseudo-sequel which changes the end of the film so that Tony Montana (originally played by Al Pacino) survives, and sets about exacting revenge on those who ousted him from power by re-establishing his drug empire in Miami.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>疤面煞星：掌握世界</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32709\">Radical Entertainment</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/31207\">Sierra Entertainment</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AAVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2006年10月10日</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"XBOX","count":1},{"name":"AAVG","count":1},{"name":"TPS","count":1},{"name":"WII","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"PS2","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":32709,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/14/a6/32709_prsn_mBHCG.jpg","name":"Radical Entertainment","desc":"开发"},{"id":31207,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a6/cd/31207_prsn_v4z4M.jpg","name":"雪乐山公司","desc":"发行"}]}
