You are challenged to construct an epic war machine and use it to become a dominating world power.\r\n\r\nMachines at War features a random map system so every game you play is unique and poses new challenges.  Build bridges to cross water, mow down forests to clear a path to the enemy, build walls to defend your position, track tread marks left by enemy tanks to their base, hide under trees for an ambush attack, these are just some of the unique game play elements available.\r\n\r\nExpand your city with over 40 structures and units to choose from.  As your empire grows you can research technologies to guide the focus of your strategy.  Choose to be a economic powerhouse and flood the enemy with an endless barrage of units.  Or upgrade your defensive forces and build an insurmountable fortification of turrets and fortresses surrounded by walls and gates.  If blitzkrieg is your style, then embolden your offensive forces with unique weapon upgrades and demoralize the enemy with an unstoppable force.\r\n\r\nBuild vehicles and aircraft to take control of the land and air including tanks, jeeps, trucks, helicopters, jets, VTOLs, turrets, and more.  After each battle detailed statistics are displayed showing the how the tides of war changed for each player.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>机械战争</li><li><span>别名: </span>战争机器</li><li><span>平台: </span>WM</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>即时策略类</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2007</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.isotope244.com/machines-at-war.html</li><li><span>游戏设计: </span>James Bryant</li><li><span>制作发行: </span>Isotope 244</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"RTS","count":1}]}
