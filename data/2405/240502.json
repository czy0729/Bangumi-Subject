It was released in Japan in February 1998, and later that year in North America in May and in Europe in June. Burning Rangers is set in a futuristic society in which fire is the remaining danger. Players control one of an elite group of firefighters, the Burning Rangers, who extinguish fires and rescue civilians in burning buildings. Most of the tasks the players complete are centred around collecting energy crystals to transport civilians to safety. In lieu of an in-game map, Burning Rangers features a voice navigation system which directs players through corridors.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>救火奇兵</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>烈火先锋</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Burning Rangers</li><li><span>平台: </span>SS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT / TPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1998年2月26日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"普通游戏","count":1},{"name":"SS","count":1},{"name":"TPS","count":1},{"name":"SEGA","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"开发"}]}
