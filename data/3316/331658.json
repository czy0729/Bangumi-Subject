The game is based on H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos and uses many elements from Lovecraft's The Dunwich Horror and The Shadow Over Innsmouth. A follow-up game, Prisoner of Ice, is not a direct sequel.\r\n\r\nShadow of the Comet: The Official Strategy Guide (Prima Publishing, 1994; re-released by the author, 2019) was written by Steve Schwartz. In addition to a game walkthrough, all game dialog, and a disk of saved games, the book includes the Lovecraft story The Call of Cthulhu.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>魔影哈雷</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/31007\">Infogrames</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/31007\">Infogrames</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Call of Cthulhu: Shadow of the Comet</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>克苏鲁传说：魔影哈雷</li><li><span>平台: </span>MS-DOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC-98</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Microsoft Windows</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年3月25日</li>","staff":[{"id":31007,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/d1/54/31007_prsn_eWW9M.jpg","name":"Infogrames","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":331657,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9a/71/331657_PyIj7.jpg","title":"Call of Cthulhu: Prisoner of Ice","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/331657"}]}
