Play carefully taking friction, gravity and temperature into account, and by using the unique properties of each type of fluid (water, oil, nitroglycerin, molten lava...) in a range of original environments. Conserve as much fluid as possible when crossing a variety of obstacles such as burning passageways, carnivorous plants and electric currents!","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PlayStation 3 (PSN)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox 360 (XBLA)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii U (eShop)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PlayStation Vita</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Microsoft Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS X, Linux</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android, PlayStation 4</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>益智解谜</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>(Microsoft Windows)(Steam) Nov-9, 2012</li><li><span>售价: </span>USD $7.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.e-neko.com/?page_id=5602</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
