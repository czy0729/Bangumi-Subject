{"id":322131,"type":4,"name":"Stardust","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/da/97/322131_rrVgw.jpg","summary":"Stardust is a multidirectional shooter video game for the Amiga, released by the Finnish company Bloodhouse in 1993. The game is essentially an Asteroids clone with enhancements, such as power-ups, shields, a high-energy techno module soundtrack, vivid use of colors and the occasional tunnel section that revolves around a sphere. The game's graphics drew critical acclaim for the aforementioned tunnels and the liberal use of ray-tracing. The company has since merged with Terramarque to form Housemarque.\r\n\r\nIn a not atypical bout of Finnish humor, the developers gave several things ludicrous names in their own language, which were (and still are) highly obscure in the international market. The damsel in distress is named after a brand of margarine, and the final confrontation takes place over the planet Imatra.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span>Bloodhouse (<a href=\"/person/40386\">Housemarque</a>)</li><li><span>发行: </span>Bloodhouse (<a href=\"/person/40386\">Housemarque</a>)</li><li><span>平台: </span>DOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari ST</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Multidirectional STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.housemarque.com/games/super-stardust/</li>","staff":[{"id":40386,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b8/07/40386_prsn_9bTSt.jpg","name":"Housemarque","desc":"开发"}]}
