Zoe Saldana stars in the four-hour, two-part (May 11 and May 15) NBC miniseries that is directed by Agnieszka Holland. Unlike earlier versions, it is set in Paris rather than New York. The work has not been well-received by critics, many of whom said that it was stretched to fill two two-hour timeslots. Although there are several notable changes, this miniseries is considered to be a fairly true updating of the original film adaptation.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>魔鬼圣婴</li><li><span>集数: </span>2</li><li><span>开始: </span>2014-05-11</li><li><span>结束: </span>2014-05-15</li><li><span>类型: </span>惊悚</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>电视台: </span>NBC</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt3087752</li>","collection":{"collect":2,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"美剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":386859,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/386859","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Night 1","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-05-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":386860,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/386860","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Night 2","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-05-15","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
