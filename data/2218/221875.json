If the payment comes even one day late, the heroine's soul will return to the afterlife.\r\n\r\nAnd so, her light-hearted, comedic adventure to save up enough money before the deadline begins.\r\n\r\nDespite the dark sounding premise, the majority of Serment will be light-hearted slice of life events (more commonly known as cute girls doing cute things).","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Visual Novel</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Ren'py</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>Late 2017</li><li><span>Indie DB: </span>http://www.indiedb.com/games/serment-contract-with-a-devil</li><li><span>itch.io: </span>https://nkt-v2.itch.io/serment-contract-with-a-devil-beta-demo</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
