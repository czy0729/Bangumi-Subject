Money literally rules the world, and most people only have a choice of submitting themselves to the goodwill of a corporation or scrounging on the leftovers of the world's rich and powerful. In this world, you take the role of Kazu, trying to stand your ground against impossible odds and becoming your own person, independent of others. Your journey will take you from the dregs to the glistening heights of luxury. You will journey through a multitude of virtual worlds, from a mythological age that never was to a future where humanity is a memory long gone by.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Action, Adventure</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>Single-player</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>Fourth Quarter 2017</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.unwontedstudios.com/warped-reality/</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"STEAM","count":1}]}
