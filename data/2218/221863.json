One night, a festival is going on in town. Instead of going with her family, Nara wanders off alone, not wanting to slow them down. As she goes through the various stalls, things become hazier and gradually Nara finds herself surrounded by people with ears, tails, and horns…then suddenly her clothes and wheelchair disappear! After a run-in with a rambunctious kitsune named Hayato and a scary-looking dragon officer of death named Shuye, Nara finds out that her soul has left her body and has been transported to the Spirit World, where all the demons and spirits are celebrating a month-long festival. Until the end of this festival, she won't be able to return home… Will Nara survive long enough in the Spirit World to go back in one piece? Will she be able to get over her bitterness borne from the past, or will she be engulfed in hatred and lose sight of what's truly important?","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>霊の夜行</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Casual, Simulation</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Ren'Py</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>Single-player</li><li><span>售价: </span>$10.00 USD</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://lettucewaltz.org/</li><li><span>itch.io: </span>https://lettucewaltz.itch.io/spirit-parade</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":1}]}
