Exploring notions of escapism, loss and a fragmented sense of self in the wake of a personal tragedy.\r\n\r\nThese pockets of dissonant clarity are a vain effort to find beauty, poetry and reason in one's bleakest and most desperate moments.\r\n\r\nEmporium is a small game lasting roughly 30 to 45 minutes. It has a minimal approach to game play, focusing on visuals and audio to build a visceral experience with sporadic dialogue choices leading the narrative.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>生死边界</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Casual, Horror</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unity</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>April 21st 2017</li><li><span>售价: </span>$1.99 USD</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://tom-kitchen.co.uk/emporium-presskit.html</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">官方网站: </span>http://www.tom-kitchen.co.uk/</li><li><span>itch.io: </span>https://tomkitchen.itch.io/emporium</li><li><span>IndieDB: </span>http://www.indiedb.com/games/emporium</li><li><span>开发: </span>Tom Kitchen</li><li><span>发行: </span>Tom Kitchen</li>","collection":{"collect":2,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"STEAM","count":1}]}
