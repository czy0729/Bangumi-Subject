Spartacus has thoughts only on vengeance; to kill Glaber, while Crixus is motivated with finding his lost love Naevia. Glaber, now Praetor with the Roman Senate, is commanded by his father-in-law to return to Capua and put down Spartacus. Ilithyia, now pregnant, wants to stay in Rome, but Glaber demands she accompany him. Meanwhile, Crixus obtains information from a brothel owner to seek Naevia in the south. Spartacus sends Aurelia, wife of his late friend Varro, north to reunite her with her son. Glaber, Ilithyia and his soldiers return to Capua and take up residence in the ludus and are shocked to find Lucretia alive but seemingly insane and she remembers very little, to Ilithyia's relief. Elsewhere, Oenomaus (Doctore) remains estranged from Spartacus and Crixus and feels extremely guilty for helping destroy the House of Batiatus. He warns them of the strength of Glaber and the Romans. Crixus urges that they should all flee south as if they kill Glaber right now they will not be able to defeat the legions they will send due to their small numbers and lack of trained fighters. Spartacus goes on his own to kill Glaber in the town square, and discovers they have captured and mortally wounded Aurelia. Spartacus eventually breaks cover and engages Glaber and his soldiers in combat. Spartacus is assisted by Crixus and the Gladiators and they escape with Aurelia as well as kill or wounded many Roman soldiers, but fail to kill Glaber who is only wounded on his left arm. Afterwards, Aurelia asks Spartacus to promise to stay away from her son before dying. Spartacus agrees with Crixus that they should march south to look for Naevia, as well as seek to free all slaves who come into their path."},{"id":147252,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/147252","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"A Place in This World","duration":"","airdate":"2012-2-3","comment":0,"desc":"Spartacus and his band of Gladiators move south, and take an isolated villa owned by a wealthly Roman, who had Naevia for a short time before sending her further south.

Spartacus choses not to have Nasir killed, but decides to train him. Back in Capua, Lucretia is viewed as an Oracle due to her surviving Spartacus' massacre; in the marketplace Lucretia receives a note from a hooded stranger. Meanwhile, Oenomaus thinks back about his purchase from the Pits by Titus Lentulus Batiatus in his youth, where he eventually states his reason for living is the honor of Titus and his House. Oenomaus fights in the Pits hoping to be killed, but he is eventually taken to the villa before Glaber as Lucretia is performing a ritual to ask the Gods to aid Glaber against Spartacus.

In Capua, Ashur tortures Oenomaus to get information on Spartacus and his men unsuccessfully. Lucretia tells Ashur to use other means to get Oenomaus to speak. Ashur reveals to Oenomaus his wife Melitta's affair with his closest friend Gannicus (see Spartacus: Gods of the Arena). Oenomaus in his disbelief inadvertently reveals the rebels' purpose of going south in search of Naevia. Glaber, focused on holding his status, neglects his wife Ilithyia. Meanwhile, Nasir can no longer bring himself to maintain Agron's lie and tells Crixus the truth. Agron takes his own group to make camp at Mt. Vesuvius. Spartacus, Crixus, and the others that remain go to the mines. Disguising themselves as slaves and guards, they infiltrate the mines in search of Naevia. However, Glaber had dispatched his soldiers to the mines, along with Ashur, and they arrive shortly afterward. After Ashur recognizes and slaughters two of Spartacus' men posing as guards, the soldiers enter the mines in pursuit. Crixus is briefly reunited with Naevia, but as they attempt to make their way out, the soldiers catch up with them.

Spartacus will suffer to leave no one behind even if it means the death of them all. The Romans lead by Glaber's Tribune Marcus are in hot pursuit, assisted by Ashur. The captured Crixus and two others are reunited with Oenomaus at the villa, where treachery abounds. Meanwhile, Glaber must ease the insult he gave to Varinius a fellow Praetor, Ilithyia suggests a party in his honor. Young Seppia seeks advice from Lucretia on seeking her future husband and sets her sights on Varinius, much to Ilithyia's envy. Ilithyia, angered by the neglect of Glaber, forms a plan to have her marriage dissolved and take Varinius as her new husband. Crixus and Oenomaus are to be executed in the arena while another is tortured to death at the hands of the party goers. Spartacus' numbers dwindle in the forest as they are killed one by one by the pursuing Romans. By the final fight only Spartacus, Mira, Naevia and the wounded Nasir are left alive. During a combat encounter, Spartacus manages to wound Marcus. Marcus insists on persisting with pursuit, against the advice of Ashur. Ashur takes Marcus further into the forest, only to finish him off before Marcus can order his troops to continue hunting Spartacus. Back in Capua, Ilithyia outshines Seppia, who was unable to participate in the torture of the prisoner, and brokers a deal with Varinius for marriage if Senator Albinius (Ilithyia's father) dissolves her marriage. Ilithyia seeks out her father among the party only to find him in bed with Lucretia. Furious, Ilithyia attacks Lucretia, but Lucretia reveals she did it only to heal past wrongs she had done to Ilithyia and help her seek her future as Varinius' wife. Ilithyia, on hearing this, manages to stay her hand.

While searching a temple with a view to spend the night, Spartacus encounters Lucius, a Roman disillusioned with Rome because of the civil war Sulla waged years before. Lucius gives shelter and information to the Rebels, mainly that the rumors that abound are that Spartacus and the Rebels are finished and all but slaughtered. He informs Spartacus that three of the rebels will be executed in the arena and that one of them is Crixus. Spartacus, unwilling to forsake Crixus and wanting to send a message to the Romans, hatches a daring plan of rescue, where they will move in and take the arena in Capua. Meanwhile, Gannicus returns to Capua to give Oenomaus a honorable death in the arena, but unaware Oenomaus knows the truth of Gannicus' affair with Melitta. Elsewhere, Lucretia dissuades Ilithyia from aborting her child, though Ilithyia must be rid of the pregnancy if she will marry Varinius. However, Lucretia manages to convince Ilithyia to delay the abortion. Lucretia, through Ashur, reveals the abortion attempt to Glaber. Ilithyia admits upon confrontation that their love and marriage is over and reveals her plan to marry Varinius to Glaber. When the primus fight starts, Oenomaus viciously attacks Gannicus and Mira is tasked to set the arena on fire on its foundations. When the arena finally collapses and most of the spectators flee, Spartacus and Agron attack the remaining gladiators and guards and escape with Gannicus, Crixus and Oenomaus, but not before Spartacus throws a spear directly at Glaber and nicks his cheek. Glaber, the last to leave the pulvinus, chances upon Senator Albinius (Ilithyia's father) trapped beneath a fallen beam, but he does not save his father-in-law, instead killing him.

Meanwhile, Glaber tests Ashur's loyalty, and through the passing of this test Ashur's status and pride is elevated, filled with his own sense of self-importance. Lucretia attempts to bring him to heel, but her efforts backfire as Ashur rapes her. Glaber, still angry and feeling the sting of betrayal, treats Ilithyia cruelly, in where she seeks casual comfort with Lucretia and schemes to win back Glaber's love. Glaber attempts to join forces with Seppius and his group of mercenaries, but is rebuffed yet again, resulting in the young Seppia being invited to the villa instead. Elsewhere, Gannicus scoffs at Spartacus and the rebels, feeling that they are fighting for a lost cause. Naevia, being haunted by her ordeal, is unable to show her love physically to Crixus, while he is unable to forgive Agron for lying about Naevia's death. Spartacus attempts to enlist Gannicus to the cause but Gannicus remains unconvinced. Lucius, the disillusioned Roman, seeks to aid in training the rebels who were once house slaves. Chadara would rather seek her place in the bed of another gladiator but is rebuffed. Also, Ashur is sent to recruit the most violent of former gladiators for Glaber's new plan. Oenomaus awakens and tells Gannicus that they were once brothers and the betrayal with Melitta is not easily forgotten or forgiven. The map on which Spartacus and Agron make their plans vanishes along with the last bit of money the rebels have. Gannicus is accused and a fight ensues between the former champions of Batiatus. The fight comes to a draw as Mira draws an arrow from her bow and shoots down Chadara who was attempting to flee with map and missing coins in hand. Gannicus also takes his leave. Back in Capua, Seppia, after some coaxing from Ilithyia, Lucretia and Glaber, agrees to speak with her brother, but to no avail since Glaber has already moved against Seppius. Along with Ashur's new recruits, Glaber slaughters Seppius and every other living being in the villa. Glaber takes his time delivering the final death blow to Seppius by stepping on his windpipe. Ashur then picks up Seppius' gold twin snake armlet with the intent on keeping it for himself.

Complications arise when Agron speaks to the slaves in their mother tongue and is overheard by a Roman guard who also shares their tongue and raises the alarm, but the operation succeeds nonetheless and the rebel army swells with Agron's distant kin. This alarms Crixus and Lucius, given the possibility that these new recruits may not follow Spartacus' orders in favor of Agron. Meanwhile in Capua, Glaber enlists the former mercenary band that belonged to young Seppius, and they pledge the Sacramentum to Glaber and to Rome. After having sex with her again, Ashur believes Lucretia is beginning to have feelings for him, and he presents her with a red wig like she used to wear as a symbol of her belonging to him. Ganniucus, prompted by Ashur, goes to the villa for an audience with Glaber, where he offers Gannicus the chance to be a beacon of hope, the front man to his army. Glaber also returns Gannicus' rudus. Ilithyia, growing ever more desperate that Glaber will never forgive her, wishes she were dead. Lucretia however comes up with a plan for Ilithyia to break free of Glaber's hatred and vengeful attitude and go home to Rome. The plan involves Lucretia fooling Glaber into thinking Ilithyia needs to go to Rome in order for the gods to bless their unborn child. After a failed attempt to bond with the new recruits on a hunting trip, which turns into highway robbery as the new recruits accost a wagon on the road, Spartacus, Crixus, and Lucius wonder whether Agron's loyalty lies with his kinsmen or with Spartacus. A great feast turns into a bloody battle after Seddulus, the biggest of all the new recruits tries to rape Naevia, after which Naevia stabs him and calls for help. Agron decides this has gone too far and helps Crixus and Spartacus control the German. Spartacus, asserting his authority as leader, fights Seddulus and brutally kills him. After witnessing the gruesome scene, Agron's tribesmen swear allegiance to Spartacus. Lucretia and Gannicus meet in the market, where Gannicus mourns for his friend from the brothel who is now crucified for merely whispering about Spartacus' fight for freedom for all. Lucretia tempts Gannicus with a plan to kill Glaber and end this conflict. Ilithyia is packed off to Rome, but not before Lucretia reveals the plan to her. Ilithyia kisses Glaber goodbye. No more than a few hours in her absence Glaber has sex with Seppia, when unfortunate news reaches him that Ilithyia's wagon was viciously attacked on the road to Rome.

From Ilithyia's information on the Rebels' location, Ashur pinpoints the site of their temple base, and as reward he is promised his freedom after the defeat of Spartacus. Ilithyia and Glaber also have a heart to heart talk, and Ilithyia finds Glaber not moved from her miraculous survival. However, Lucretia is quite happy and tells Ilithyia of the latest happenings and of Glaber's murder of Seppius, and Ilithyia and Lucretia set young Seppia on a path of vengeance. Meanwhile, rounds of friendly bouts to end current grievances are set up by Spartacus, as old insults and past wrongs are put right in these friendly battles. Ashur reveals to Lucretia that as well as freedom, Glaber will give Ashur the ludus and his blessing of marriage with Lucretia if Spartacus falls in the upcoming battle. Lucretia is quite dismayed at the loss of her husband's legacy. Varinius returns to Capua (at the secret bidding of Seppia) with directions from the Senate that Glaber is to leave Capua and return to Rome. Varinius is rebuffed by Glaber, and warns of further ruin if Glaber does not obey. Varinius is angered at Seppia's lack of strong evidence of Glaber's wrongdoings and murderous deeds. Lucretia gives a final pep talk to convince Seppia to make attempt on Glaber's life. At the final moment before Seppia's dagger is thrust into Glaber, Ilithyia, from behind, grabs Seppia's dagger, stabs Seppia in her heart and proceeds to violently slit her throat. Glaber and Ilithyia come to a mutual understanding about their marriage, as Ilithyia fuels passion with ambitious talk of power that they both must seek to acquire. The Roman attack on the Rebel temple goes forward, Varinius' and Glaber's forces in attendance. Spartacus and Gannicus capture Varinius in the first assault, catching him unaware in the forest. In the temple forecourt, whoever mostly remained of Varinius' frontal assault lay dead, but then huge fire projectiles are hurled into the temple. Varinius is hit by a projectile and is presumably killed. Glaber, his men and Ashur storm the temple. Overrun, Spartacus and the rebels use their escape tunnels to leave, but not before Oenomaus loses his left eye while fighting the fierce Egyptian mercenary and losses of at least half of the Rebels. Cutting Glaber off from pursuit, the Rebels exit the tunnels only to have their retreat cut off by the rest of Glaber's forces. With no other path that does not lead to certain death, the Rebels take to the steep mountain paths of Mt. Vesuvius.

The ambush fails but some of the rebels, led by Spartacus, arrive to save their companions and a battle breaks out. Mira is killed by an axe meant for Spartacus. Meanwhile, Lucretia and a pregnant Ilithyia travel to Mt. Vesuvius where Ilithyia has a conversation with Glaber that convinces him that Ashur was working with Seppia to kill him, and suggest that he get rid of Ashur. Glaber agrees with her and in return asks Ilithyia to murder Lucretia because her role as oracle serves no purpose anymore, and this task will win his trust. Glaber bribes Ashur's soldiers to betray the troublesome Ashur and then forces him to go on a suicide mission to prove himself, confronting Spartacus and his followers alone and bargaining for their surrender. Ashur's offer is declined when he reveals that Spartacus will be killed upon surrender and his followers would once again become slaves. Ashur begins to depart when Crixus suggests that they execute him. Spartacus agrees with this and Naevia convinces Crixus to allow her to fight him. After a protracted duel, Naevia decapitates Ashur. Spartacus comes up with a plan to ambush the Roman encampment. They weave rappelling vines and Spartacus, Agron, Crixus, and Gannicus descend down the mountain behind the Roman guards. At the bottom of their descent, they take control of the siege weapons to set fire to the camp and leave the legion in disarray. The rest of the rebels join in the battle, attacking from the side. Meanwhile, before Ilithyia is able to push Lucretia from the ludus' balcony her water breaks. At first Lucretia is pretending to help Ilithyia deliver her baby but after killing Ilithyia's slaves, Lucretia cuts Ilithyia's newborn son from her womb and commits suicide by jumping off the ludus' cliff with the baby in her arms. Ilithyia, witnessing all this, collapses and apparently dies from shock and loss of blood.[12] The battle between Glaber's forces and the rebels rages on and Oenomaus and Gannicus battle the Egyptian gladiator. Gannicus manages to kill the Egyptian mercenary but Oenomaus is fatally wounded and dies in Gannicus's arms. Spartacus has a one-on-one sword fight with Glaber. Glaber boasts that his death and the destruction of his legion will bring many more legions of Roman soldiers after them and the rebels will never win in the long run. In response, Spartacus shoves his sword down Glaber's throat, killing him.
