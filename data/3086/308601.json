{"id":308601,"type":4,"name":"Shark Jaws","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b4/cd/308601_APIcY.jpg","summary":"Shark Jaws is a single-player arcade game by Atari Inc. under the name of Horror Games, originally released in 1975. An unlicensed tie-in to the movie Jaws, and believed to be the first commercially released movie tie-in, it was created to be a game about sharks eating people. Atari head Nolan Bushnell originally tried to license the Jaws name for the game, but was unable to secure a license from Universal Pictures. Deciding to go ahead with the game anyway, it was retitled Shark JAWS, with the word Shark in tiny print and JAWS in large all caps print to create greater prominence. Bushnell also created a second hidden subsidiary corporation, Horror Games—the previous being Kee Games, to help isolate Atari from a possible lawsuit. According to Bushnell, the game was successful enough to sell approximately two thousand units.\r\n\r\n引自英文维基百科。","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a> / Horror Games</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Horror</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1975年9月25日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
