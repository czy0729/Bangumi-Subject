Six to eight wordless panels is often all it takes Kirchner to display his sense for the bizarre. In the bus, fire hydrants come alive, buses chose to stray away from the law, the distant horizon might be just an arm's length away and the whole world might just turn out to be a two-dimensional panel messing with our sense of depth. More bizarre yet, in 25 years since its original publication in the USA by Ballantine Books in 1987, the bus has never been republished.\r\nThis new edition contains the entire collection of strips drawn by Paul Kirchner, including a half dozen strips previously unreleased. It also includes a postscript and a new cover by Paul Kirchner.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>巴士</li><li><span>作者: </span>Paul Kirchner</li><li><span>出版社: </span>Editions Tanibis</li><li><span>连载杂志: </span>Heavy Metal</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2012-03-01</li><li><span>页数: </span>96</li><li><span>语言: </span>English</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>9782848410227</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":1},{"name":"漫画","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":308644,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/1a/9d/308644_0bLL7.jpg","title":"The Bus 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/308644"}]}
