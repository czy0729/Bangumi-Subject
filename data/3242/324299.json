{"id":324299,"type":3,"name":"Deus Ex Soundtrack","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6d/a9/324299_zNDiW.jpg","rating":{"total":1,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":0,"9":0,"10":1},"score":10},"summary":"The music in Deus Ex was composed by Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, and Dan Gardopee and is a mixture of jazz, techno, and classical influenced ambient tracks, each of which provides a great enhancement to the mysterious and gritty atmosphere of the game.\r\n\r\nThe game also features a dynamic music system. Whenever a player enters combat, the music will shift from slow paced to fast paced and adrenaline pumping. The music will also change whenever a player enters a conversation with another person and after level transitions. The implementation of this transitional style of music creates yet another layer to this already immensely deep game.\r\n\r\nThe first release of Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition came with a second separate CD containing a high quality recording of the soundtrack. Note that it does not include every piece of music in the game, the tracks being made up from sections of the dynamic loops in each map or area. The Main Title theme is also the orchestral re-recorded version featured in Deus Ex: The Conspiracy.","info":"<li><span>厂牌: </span><a href=\"/person/17043\">Eidos Interactive</a></li><li><span>发售日期: </span>2001</li><li><span>作曲: </span>Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, Dan Gardopée, Reeves Gabrels</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Main Title","href":"/ep/999788"},{"title":"2 Intro Sequence","href":"/ep/999789"},{"title":"3 Liberty Island","href":"/ep/999790"},{"title":"4 UNATCO","href":"/ep/999791"},{"title":"5 Battery Park","href":"/ep/999792"},{"title":"6 NYC Streets","href":"/ep/999793"},{"title":"7 Lebedev's Airfield","href":"/ep/999794"},{"title":"8 Airfield Action","href":"/ep/999795"},{"title":"9 Enemy Within","href":"/ep/999796"},{"title":"10 Desolation (Hong Kong Canal)","href":"/ep/999797"},{"title":"11 The Synapse (Hong Kong Streets)","href":"/ep/999798"},{"title":"12 Hong Kong Action","href":"/ep/999799"},{"title":"13 Majestic 12 Labs","href":"/ep/999800"},{"title":"14 Versalife","href":"/ep/999801"},{"title":"15 Naval Base","href":"/ep/999802"},{"title":"16 Paris Streets","href":"/ep/999803"},{"title":"17 DuClare Chateau","href":"/ep/999804"},{"title":"18 Paris Action","href":"/ep/999805"},{"title":"19 Return To NYC","href":"/ep/999806"},{"title":"20 Oceanlab","href":"/ep/999807"},{"title":"21 Ocean Action","href":"/ep/999808"},{"title":"22 Oceanlab Complex","href":"/ep/999809"},{"title":"23 Vandenberg","href":"/ep/999810"},{"title":"24 Begin The End (Bunker)","href":"/ep/999811"},{"title":"25 Area 51","href":"/ep/999812"},{"title":"26 Ending 1","href":"/ep/999813"},{"title":"27 Ending 2","href":"/ep/999814"},{"title":"28 Ending 3","href":"/ep/999815"},{"title":"29 The Illuminati","href":"/ep/999816"},{"title":"30 DX Club Mix","href":"/ep/999817"}]}],"staff":[{"id":17043,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/3c/71/17043_prsn_U3DbI.jpg","name":"艺夺","desc":"厂牌"}],"relations":[{"id":88571,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3c/00/88571_1Kk40.jpg","title":"Deus Ex","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/88571"}]}
