It features 64 teams' countries. Each team enters a \"Regional Qualifying Round Final\" where it plays a team it actually played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification. For example: Spain would face Yugoslavia, an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group. Or Italy would face Russia, an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs. If the player beats the opponent, it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup. In fact, the team faces opponents that were actually in its group. For example: Mexico would face the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea. It is a re-make of Super Sidekicks 3. However, animations and designs were exactly the same. The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup, kits again to reflect the World Cup, and players to resemble squads from the World Cup (teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers). Its slogan is \"We got the kick\".","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>机皇杯: 胜利之路</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/705\">SNK</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/705\">SNK</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Neo Geo Cup '98: The Road to the Victory</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Neo Geo Cup '98</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Neo Geo</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Neo Geo Pocket</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1998年3月3日</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"PS4","count":1},{"name":"SPG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":705,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a5/82/705_prsn_o7m1w.jpg","name":"SNK","desc":"开发"}]}
