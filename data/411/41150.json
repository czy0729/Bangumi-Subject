He's careful about the water he drinks, but gets violently ill anyway. He climbs down a waterfall using a vine, and floats down a river to the ocean on a raft he crafts out of balsawood to demonstrate how someone lost in the jungle can make it to civilization. He encounters snakes, mosquitoes and dangerous river currents."},{"id":175737,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/175737","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Alaskan Mountain Range","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"Grylls is dropped in the Chugach Mountains in Alaska, with skis and his usual gear.

The skiff sinks, but he reaches the shore and is spotted by a ship."},{"id":175738,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/175738","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Mount Kilauea","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"Grylls is dropped by helicopter at the top of Mount Kilauea. Made up of an expanse of solidified lava which stretches for 33,000 acres, this environment is one of the world's most inhospitable. He first traverses lava fields, which catch his boots on fire, then heads into the jungles of Hawaii. Grylls uses a kukui nut torch to explore a lava tube and finds water, then uses smoke to placate a bee hive to get honey. Ultimately, he finds the sea (and people) by following seabirds."},{"id":175739,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/175739","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Sierra Nevada","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"Grylls parachutes into the Sierra Nevadas, simulating the situation of the hundreds of hikers who become stranded there each year. Equipped with a knife and a canteen, Grylls travels through the alpine, woodland and chaparral areas of the mountains. He unsuccessfully tries to tame a wild horse, and eats a live snake. Using techniques gleaned from the Mono Indians, he brushes his teeth with a manzanita leaf. Most of the ground he covers is traversed by river, using a raft held together by grape vine."},{"id":175740,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/175740","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"African Savannah","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"Grylls parachutes into Northern Kenya.

He also eats maggots and uses them to catch a trout. He performs a Tyrolean traverse and makes himself a pair of snow shoes out of young trees and parachute lines."},{"id":175742,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/175742","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Deserted Island","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"Grylls is kicked out by helicopter into the water near a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean.
