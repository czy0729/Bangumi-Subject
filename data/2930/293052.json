All-new activities, like soccer, and big seasonal festivals and celebrations bring the spirit of each season to life. Your Sims can pucker up at the kissing booth at the spring festival, or see what Halloween surprises await in the haunted house. Dress for the weather with seasonal fashions from wetsuits to raincoats and snow gear. With new foods, décor and weather effects, your Sims can enjoy the bounty and beauty of the ever-changing seasons and play with life like never before!","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>模拟人生3：春夏秋冬</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>模拟</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2012年11月21日</li>","collection":{"collect":2,"on_hold":1},"relations":[{"id":1616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/96/2e/1616_LdHsN.jpg","title":"The Sims 3","type":"主线故事","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/1616"}]}
