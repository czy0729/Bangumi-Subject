This new game is being developed from the ground up exclusively for VR, and coming to the Oculus Rift platform.\r\nMedal of Honor: Above and Beyond is an action-packed and incredibly immersive VR experience set in World War II, where you step into the boots of an agent of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in war torn Europe. A deep single-player campaign takes you through historic events on land, air, and sea, sabotaging Nazi bases, subverting enemy plans, aiding the French Resistance, and much, much more. With the Oculus Rift, we’re bringing players into the Medal of Honor series in an entirely new way, with an experience that transports you back to Europe in the 1940s. It’s the closest thing to a time machine you’ll ever see.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/26166\">Respawn Entertainment</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>荣誉勋章：超越极限</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>荣誉勋章：超越巅峰</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC (VR)</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2020年12月11日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.oculus.com/medal-of-honor/</li>","collection":{"wish":1},"staff":[{"id":26166,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/04/bc/26166_prsn_vn1S4.jpg","name":"重生娱乐","desc":"开发"},{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"艺电","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":41423,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6b/3b/41423_5aKeq.jpg","title":"Medal of Honor: Warfighter","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/41423"}]}
