Only tiles with one side 'open' not touching another tile can be matched with each other. The game runs on a timer, so you have to move fast to clear the entire screen.\r\nIn two-Player mode, the game can be played either competitively or co-operatively. In the competitive mode, the screen is split and each player has his or her own stack of tiles to clear. The object is to clear tiles to reveal the elusive 'gold' tile. The first player to find the gold tile in each round wins. In co-operative mode, the game is played exactly like in one-Player mode except that there are two pointers on the screen.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>上海3</li><li><span>别名: </span>Shanghai Ⅲ</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年9月15日</li><li><span>开发: </span>SunSoft</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"relations":[{"id":107751,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/97/5d/107751_0DEe3.jpg","title":"上海Ⅱ","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/107751"},{"id":107738,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/93/6e/107738_sKh4c.jpg","title":"Shanghai Ⅱ: Dragon's Eye","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/107738"},{"id":107752,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f9/fa/107752_yhho5.jpg","title":"上海 万里の長城","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/107752"}]}
