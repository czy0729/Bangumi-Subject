It is a member of Activision's Shanghai series of mahjong solitaire games — to be precise, it is a port of the Japanese version of what the Western market got as Shanghai II: Dragon's Eye; the numbering discrepancy was because of a Japanese Shanghai II that had already been made.\r\n\r\nActivision were not happy with this version of the game, and instead produced their own Shanghai II: Dragon's Eye for the Western market.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>龙之眼Plus 上海Ⅲ</li><li><span>别名: </span>Dragon's Eye Plus: Shanghai III</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1991年11月2日</li><li><span>售价: </span>5,800円</li><li><span>开发: </span>HOME DATA</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"relations":[{"id":107738,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/93/6e/107738_sKh4c.jpg","title":"Shanghai Ⅱ: Dragon's Eye","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/107738"}]}
