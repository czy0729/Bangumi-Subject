Hon Jim Hacker is back in office as PM, leading a coalition government confronting the greatest economic crisis in a generation.\r\n\r\nWith European economies going down the toilet, a tempting energy deal from an unusual source, a leadership crisis with his coalition partners, a Scottish independence referendum and the greatest moral dilemma he has ever faced... there's lots for Hacker to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe ultimately powerful but beleaguered Prime Minister is once again 'assisted' by his impenetrably loquacious Cabinet Secretary, Sir Humphrey Appleby, and torn but sensible Principal Private Secretary, Bernard Woolley. There is one person definitely on his side though: Policy Unit Head, Claire Sutton.\r\n\r\nThe six episodes are set in Chequers, the country residence of the Prime Minister and observe the unfolding drama as Hacker tries to negotiate Britain out of a financial crisis.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>是, 首相 2013新版</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>2</li><li><span>别名: </span>是, 首相 新篇</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>是, 首相 现代版</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Yes, Prime Minister (2013 Version)</li><li><span>集数: </span>6</li><li><span>开始: </span>2013-01-15</li><li><span>结束: </span>2013-02-19</li><li><span>类型: </span>Comedy</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>UK</li><li><span>语言: </span>English</li><li><span>每集长: </span>30</li><li><span>频道: </span>Gold</li><li><span>电视台: </span>GOLD</li><li><span>首播国家: </span>英国</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/yes_prime_minister_2013/</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt2612376</li><li><span>主演: </span>David Haig, Henry Goodman, Chris Larkin, Zoe Telford</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Antony Jay, Jonathan Lynn</li><li><span>Production: </span>British Broadcasting Corporation</li>","collection":{"wish":11,"collect":30,"doing":1,"on_hold":1,"dropped":5},"tags":[{"name":"英剧","count":14},{"name":"2013","count":6},{"name":"TV","count":4},{"name":"gold","count":2},{"name":"完结","count":2},{"name":"是，大臣","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":233798,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/233798","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Crisis At The Summit","name_cn":"峰会危机","duration":"00:29:54","airdate":"2013-01-15","comment":0,"desc":"Jim Hacker's premiership is falling apart when a saviour appears - Kumranistan!","status":"Air"},{"id":233799,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/233799","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"The Poisoned Chalice","name_cn":"蜜糖陷阱","duration":"00:29:49","airdate":"2013-01-22","comment":0,"desc":"Jim holds a dinner to welcome the Kumranistan Foreign Secretary.","status":"Air"},{"id":233800,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/233800","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Gentlemen's Agreement","name_cn":"绅士协议","duration":"00:29:50","airdate":"2013-01-29","comment":0,"desc":"Humphrey's pro-Euro scheme has been stymied.
