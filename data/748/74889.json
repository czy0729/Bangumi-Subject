Twelve weeks earlier, Kade Prurnell (Cynthia Nixon), an investigator for the Inspector General's Office, warns Crawford of his misconduct and pressures Alana Bloom into repealing her statement about Crawford's mishandling of Graham's instability, which she refuses. Lecter gets to walk in Graham's shoes when six partially preserved bodies are found in a river. Lecter theorizes that the killer is preserving the bodies to create a human model collection and that those in the river are imperfect castoffs. In the Baltimore asylum, Graham is determined to uncover how Lecter set him up and enlists Alana to help him recover lost memories through hypnosis. He has a flashback of Lecter inserting Abigail Hobbs' ear into his stomach through his throat.

Crawford puts his job at risk by testifying that he may have pushed Graham too far by keeping him on the investigative team, though the admission allows him some relief. Graham's lawyer receives a severed ear in the mail, cut from a corpse within the previous forty-eight hours, causing doubts to stir among those who believe in Graham's guilt. Katz, Price, and Zeller determine that the ear was severed using the same knife that cut off Abigail Hobbs' ear, which was signed out of the courthouse evidence room by the bailiff in Graham's trial, Andrew Sykes. A large fire is triggered when the FBI raid his apartment, but it does not destroy a key piece of evidence: Sykes' body mounted on a stag's head, missing an ear, face cut into a Glasgow smile and set on fire: all of the things Graham supposedly did to his victims. Lecter presents the forensics report to Graham, who deduces that Sykes was killed in too different a manner from the others to be the same killer. Lecter agrees, but urges Will to lie about who he thinks killed Sykes in order to exonerate himself. The prosecution picks up on the dissimilarities as well, and succeeds in having the bailiff's murder deemed inadmissible. The next day, the judge in Graham's trial is found brutally murdered and displayed in the courtroom.

An acupuncturist (Amanda Plummer) lobotomizes patients in suffering, leaving them to die in meadows. Her first victim is found with a beehive occupying his half-empty skull; the second is found still standing, braindead but physically alive. After the second victim is discovered, he is immediately connected to the first as patients of the acupuncturist. When Crawford visits her, she turns herself in without a fuss. Bella Crawford talks to Hannibal about the possibility of suicide in the face of her lung cancer, something which he encourages, citing Socrates and describing death as a \"cure\". Later, Bella visits Hannibal's office after taking an overdose of morphine, and falls unconscious. After flipping a coin, Hannibal saves her life with a naloxone shot. Later he visits her and Jack and the hospital, and Bella slaps him. Beverly Katz, on Will's advice, examines the body of James Gray, the mural killer. She finds that the stitches connecting him to the mural were also surgical stitches on an opening through which his kidney was removed.

A post-mortem examination of Katz reveals that her kidneys were removed and replaced with the kidneys of James Gray, the mural killer. Graham convinces Chilton to return Abel Gideon to the asylum, to glean information about the Chesapeake Ripper's identity. Graham uses Lounds to write an article, hoping to inspire contact from the killer of the bailiff and the judge at his trial. An orderly at the asylum (Jonathan Tucker) confesses to Graham that he killed the bailiff Andrew Sykes, hoping it would exonerate Graham, but the death of the judge was someone else's work. Graham instructs the orderly to kill Hannibal Lecter. Gideon overhears this and gives Alana Bloom the chance to save Graham from himself.

Graham assures Crawford that if the Ripper is killing again, Lecter will be throwing a dinner party. Sure enough, Lecter soon invites Crawford to a gathering he is hosting. Meanwhile, local city councilor Sheldon Isley is found surgically grafted onto a tree in a parking lot (for which Isley brokered the development deal and in the process destroyed the habitat of some rare songbirds), his chest cavity emptied of all organs except his lungs and stuffed with poisonous flowers. The autopsy reveals a number of Ripper tell-tale signs and that Isley was drowned. Price and Zeller determine from the water in his lungs that he was killed within a fifty-mile radius. Chilton records Abel Gideon confessing to Graham that he was in Lecter's home, but Gideon denies this when questioned by Crawford. Gideon is beaten by a pair of guards and put in the infirmary. Lecter throws his dinner party and Crawford takes a few samples of the food to Price and Zeller to be tested. Alana and Lecter sleep together and Lecter kidnaps Gideon from the infirmary while she is sleeping (helped by a drugged glass of wine). The infirmary guard is killed and strung up with fishing lines. Lecter then cooks and serves Gideon's leg to him as a last meal. Though Price and Zeller do not find any human tissue in the samples of Lecter's food, they do find body materials in the fishing lures used on the infirmary guard from Ripper victims like the judge, James Gray, Miriam Lass, all the way back to Marissa Schur.

Graham is released from the asylum and urges Dr. Chilton to share what he knows about Lecter's unusual psychiatric treatment on Graham, by confessing his own psychic driving of Abel Gideon. Graham figures out that Alana and Lecter are together and warns her to stay away from him. He visits with Miriam and tells her about the light therapy used to induce his blackouts. Miriam recalls similar experiences with her captor. He then drops in on Lecter and confronts him with a gun. He says killing Lecter would feel right, but ultimately doesn't. Crawford takes Miriam to Lecter's office and he performs hypnotic regression therapy on her. The last thing she remembers before being captured is the Wound Man illustration. Price and Zeller find one of Lecter's fingerprints on a flower from Sheldon Isley's body, which the team finds hard to think isn't planted given the Ripper's carefulness. Drugs are found in Miriam's blood which were used in both Graham and Gideon's treatments, pointing either to Lecter or Chilton as suspects. Crawford wants them both brought in, but Lecter moves first and frames Chilton by placing Gideon's mutilated body in Chilton's house and murdering the two FBI agents who were to bring Chilton in for questioning, dressing one of them as the Wound Man. Chilton goes to Graham for help, intending to flee the country, but Crawford catches up with him first and brings him into custody.

Performing an autopsy, the horse victim is found to have a live bird trapped in her chest cavity, and soil found inside her throat leads the FBI to a mass burial ground. Graham questions Peter further, who states he placed the soil to lead them to his social worker Clark Ingram (Chris Diamantopoulos), who is responsible for the mass grave and horse victim. Clark, assigned to assist Peter following his injury, performs an interview with Dr. Bloom, which leads Graham to accuse him of being the real killer; despite Clark's counter-accusation of Peter, Graham sympathizes with Peter's vulnerable state, and believes he too is being manipulated. Peter returns to the stables, only to find Clark has used a hammer to kill the horse that injured him, further implicating him. Graham and Lecter, arriving at the stables as Peter sews up the dead horse's torso, learn he placed Clark inside the horse, only for Peter to soon reveal he did not murder Clark beforehand. Returning to find Clark emerging the horse and picking up his hammer, Graham holds him at gunpoint and threatens to kill him for trying to frame Peter for his crimes.

Crawford asks Lecter and Graham to analyze Tier's corpse, parts of which have been combined with a saber-tooth display, and pretend to examine the scene by discussing Graham's actions.
