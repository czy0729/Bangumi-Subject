It is Konami's second attempt in the 3D arcade fighting game market after their 1997 3D arcade fighting game Fighting Bujutsu. It is powered by the Konami M2 Hardware, which is Konami's version of the Panasonic M2. Like Fighting Bujutsu, Battle Tryst was never ported to any home console after its arcade release.\r\nBattle Tryst uses a three-button 8-way joystick layout that is similar to the one in Sega's Virtua Fighter series, as well as the time release being adopted from Namco's Tekken series.\r\nThe opening and character endings use real Japanese animation. Film director Mamoru Oshii took charge of the storyboard of the animations, while Shuzilow.HA designed the characters. Protagonists of the Castlevania series Simon Belmont and Richter Belmont were planned to appear in Battle Tryst, as well as Madoka from the TwinBee series, but all three were canceled.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>约会战役</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>人物设定: </span><a href=\"/person/2756\">濱川修二郎</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Battle Tryst</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>幽会之战</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1998年2月</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"FTG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":747,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/c1/747_prsn_43cah.jpg","name":"科乐美","desc":"开发"},{"id":2756,"image":"","name":"滨川修二郎","desc":"人物设定"}],"relations":[{"id":73709,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/8e/b1/73709_zt7O3.jpg","title":"出たな!! ツインビー","type":"角色出演","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/73709"},{"id":79353,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6e/4a/79353_j7qm0.jpg","title":"ガイアポリス","type":"角色出演","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/79353"}]}
