Amy and Rory are trapped on a stricken space liner that’s plummeting through banks of thick icy fog to the surface of the planet below. Only one man has the power to save them; only one man is in possession of a machine that can clear the fog and let them land safely. That man is Kazran Sardick, a rich but lonely old miser who rules Sardicktown with a sky-mast of iron. \r\n　　The Doctor’s only chance of rescuing the ship’s 4,000 passengers is to save Kazran’s soul and show him that life is worth living. For this he needs to go back, way back, to when Kazran was a boy with a life full of promise. But can the Doctor put a song in Kazran’s heart and love in his life, in time for Christmas? Can he bring him out of the dark?","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>神秘博士2010圣诞特别篇</li><li><span>主演: </span><a href=\"/person/39648\">Michael Gambon</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>神秘博士: 圣诞颂歌</li><li><span>集数: </span>1</li><li><span>开始: </span>2010-12-25</li><li><span>结束: </span>2010-12-25</li><li><span>类型: </span>科幻</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>电视台: </span>BBC</li>","collection":{"on_hold":1,"dropped":1,"wish":3,"collect":50,"doing":0},"tags":[{"name":"英剧","count":13},{"name":"神秘博士","count":7},{"name":"BBC","count":7},{"name":"DW","count":4},{"name":"SP","count":3},{"name":"科幻","count":3},{"name":"Whoniverse","count":2},{"name":"2010","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":374863,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/374863","type":1,"sort":0,"name":"A Christmas Carol","duration":"","airdate":"2010-12-25","comment":0,"desc":""}],"staff":[{"id":39648,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/38/98/39648_prsn_UYL3t.jpg","name":"Michael Gambon","desc":"主演"}],"relations":[{"id":4613,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ee/ae/4613_Ke5jq.jpg","title":"Doctor Who (series 5)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/4613"},{"id":16364,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a1/04/16364_E1Z3E.jpg","title":"Doctor Who (series 6)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/16364"}]}
