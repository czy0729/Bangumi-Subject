Among other things, TGM2 introduced the less-intimidating Normal Mode to attract more casual gamers, as well as an all-new grading system in Master Mode, the continuation of TGM's original gameplay which extends the classic TGM gameplay with larger speed increases, more requirements to achieve the M or GM grades. Shortly after TGM2 was released, Arika offered a free upgrade to a PLUS version, which added TGM+ Mode and T.A. Death Mode.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>俄罗斯方块大师2</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/35387\">ARIKA</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32779\">彩京</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>テトリス ジ・アブソリュート ザ・グランドマスター2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>TGM2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Tetris The Grand Master 2</li><li><span>平台: </span>街机/Arcade</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1-2</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2000年10月</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"TGM","count":1},{"name":"ARIKA","count":1},{"name":"俄罗斯方块","count":1},{"name":"街机","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":35387,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/f1/ac/35387_prsn_aav14.jpg","name":"ARIKA","desc":"开发"},{"id":32779,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/c2/6b/32779_prsn_E5mmE.jpg","name":"彩京","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":307247,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6f/45/307247_LFtE4.jpg","title":"Tetris The Grand Master","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/307247"},{"id":295805,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c4/b6/295805_336Er.jpg","title":"TETRIS THE GRAND MASTER 3 -Terror Instinct-","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/295805"}]}
