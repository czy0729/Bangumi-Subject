{"id":290994,"type":4,"name":"John Wick Hex","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/25/99/290994_6CcTg.jpg","summary":"John Wick Hex is a fast-paced, action-oriented strategy game that makes you think and strike like John Wick, the professional hitman of the critically acclaimed film franchise. Created in close cooperation with the creative teams behind the films, John Wick Hex is fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game, capturing the series’ signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe. Players must make quick decisions and choose every action and attack they make, all the while considering their immediate cost and consequences.\r\nFeaturing a unique blend of strategic momentum-based combat, John Wick Hex captures the feel of the unique tactical combat from the films and blurs the line between the strategy and action video game genres. Perform well and progress in the main story mode (which features an original story created for the game) to unlock new weapons, suit options and locations. Each weapon changes up the tactics you’ll use and the manner in which you’ll play. Ammo is finite and realistically simulated, so time your reloads and make the most of weapons you scavenge on the job.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>疾速追杀Hex</li><li><span>别名: </span>疾速备战Hex</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SLG, ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019年10月8日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Bithell Games</li><li><span>发行: </span>Good Shepherd Entertainment</li>","collection":{"wish":2},"tags":[{"name":"普通游戏","count":1},{"name":"SLG","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":289181,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/97/45/289181_XFZ4t.jpg","title":"John Wick 3: Parabellum","type":"三次元","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/289181"}]}
