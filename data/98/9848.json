As the deaths are investigated by journalist Cal McCaffrey of The Herald (Simm) and his colleagues (including Kelly Macdonald as Della Smith and Bill Nighy as editor Cameron Foster) it appears that not only were the deaths connected, but that a conspiracy links them with oil industry-backed corruption of high-ranking British government ministers. However, it later transpires that Collins may have known more that he was letting on.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>政局密云</li><li><span>集数: </span>6</li><li><span>开始: </span>18 May 2003</li><li><span>结束: </span>22 June 2003</li><li><span>类型: </span>Thriller</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>United Kingdom</li><li><span>每集长: </span>57 minutes</li><li><span>频道: </span>BBC One</li><li><span>电视台: </span>BBC</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0362192</li><li><span>导演: </span>David Yates</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Paul Abbott</li><li><span>主演: </span>David Morrissey John Simm Kelly Macdonald Polly Walker Bill Nighy Philip Glenister James McAvoy</li><li><span>制片人: </span>Hilary Bevan Jones</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":4},"tags":[{"name":"英剧","count":4},{"name":"BBC","count":3},{"name":"Chris_Seager","count":1},{"name":"Nicholas_Hooper","count":1},{"name":"Hilary_Bevan_Jones","count":1},{"name":"Paul_Abbott","count":1},{"name":"David_Yates","count":1},{"name":"伦理","count":1},{"name":"剧情","count":1},{"name":"悬疑","count":1},{"name":"Mark_Day","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":56097,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/56097","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Episode 1","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"18 May 2003","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":56098,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/56098","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Episode 2","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"25 May 2003","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":56099,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/56099","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Episode 3","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"1 June 2003","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":56100,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/56100","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Episode 4","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"8 June 2003","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":56101,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/56101","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Episode 5","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"15 June 2003","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":56102,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/56102","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Episode 6","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"22 June 2003","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
