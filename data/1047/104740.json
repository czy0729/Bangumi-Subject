{"id":104740,"type":4,"name":"Cubic Castles","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/69/c3/104740_e54pZ.jpg","summary":"Cubic Castles is a great new massively multiplayer building/terraforming game that mixes of Minecraft and Animal Crossing and adds a dash of 3D platforming/exploration to create a fun, easily accessible MMO that everyone can enjoy. Although technically it’s an MMO, there’s no messing about with filling out personal details and email addresses, just download, choose a name and play. It’s made by a small group of former PopCap developers who got together to make a unique, fun & light-hearted MMO. The world is full of warmth and charm, and the things you can build are only limited by your imagination. The world map is divided into areas, with each player having their own realm, signified by a castle on the map, where you can build, craft and fully personalize your space. You can visit other players realms or go mining and scavenging for more building materials to shared areas of the map. There are also plenty of customisation for your character.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>Cubic Castle</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>方堡</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>OS X</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>独立沙盘 / 建造 / MMO / 2.5D</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>多人在线</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2013-05-18 (Beta)</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.cubiccastles.com</li>","collection":{"dropped":1}}
