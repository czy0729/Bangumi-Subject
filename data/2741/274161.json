A beautiful uptown office remains unoccupied, despite its prime location. A downtown artist berates himself for selling out, while a Wall Street investor congratulates himself on a job well done. Just normal life in the big city? Or is something more sinister binding these events together? \r\n\r\nBizarre connections are a dime a dozen for the Blackwell family, but just how far back do they go? Medium Rosangela Blackwell and her spirit guide Joey Mallone are about to find out. \r\n\r\nThis is the third in the series begun by \"Blackwell 1: Legacy\" and \"Blackwell 2: Unbound\". The story is concluded in \"Blackwell 4: Deception\" and \"Blackwell 5: Epiphany\".","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>布莱克威尔3：集合</li><li><span>平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>像素解谜</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2009-07-22</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://store.steampowered.com/app/80350/Blackwell_Convergence/</li>","collection":{"collect":3}}
