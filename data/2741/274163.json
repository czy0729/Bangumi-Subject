He cries for help. He cries for answers. Then he screams as he is torn apart like damp tissue paper. \r\n\r\nThis wasn’t the first time, and it won’t be the last. \r\n\r\nThe police are powerless to stop it, so the duty falls to the only ones who can. What force could be so powerful – and so malevolent – that it would destroy the very core of a life in order to get what it wants? Rosa Blackwell and Joey Mallone mean to find out, even if it means risking themselves in the process. \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth in the series begun by \"Blackwell 1: Legacy\" , \"Blackwell 2: Unbound\" , \"Blackwell 3: Convergence\" and \"Blackwell 4: Deception\".","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>布莱克威尔5：显灵</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>像素解谜</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2014-04-25</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://store.steampowered.com/app/236930/Blackwell_Epiphany/</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
