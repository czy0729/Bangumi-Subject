The title character is a tall, leather-clad secret agent from the nation of Monica, skilled in assassination and acrobatics. Her mission is to infiltrate the strongholds of the neighboring country of Bregna, which is led by her sometimes-nemesis and sometimes-lover Trevor Goodchild. Monica represents a dynamic anarchist society, while Bregna embodies a police state — referred to on one occasion as a republic by Goodchild.[4][5] Although Bregna is shown to be repressive, in the first full-length episode, \"Utopia or Deuteranopia?\", Clavius, the president deposed by Goodchild, is described by a questioning journalist as having been democratically elected. In the same episode, an upper house of parliament is also mentioned by the character Gildemere.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>魔力女战士</li><li><span>话数: </span>16</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>1991年11月30日</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>MTV</li><li><span>其他电视台: </span>http://www.mtv.com/shows/aeon_flux/series.jhtml</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>1995年10月10日</li>","collection":{"wish":10,"collect":4,"doing":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"1990","count":1},{"name":"TV","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":856830,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856830","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856831,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856831","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856832,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856832","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856833,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856833","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856834,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856834","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856835,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856835","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856836,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856836","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856837,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856837","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856838,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856838","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856839,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856839","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856840,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856840","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856841,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856841","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856842,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856842","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856843,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856843","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856844,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856844","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":856845,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856845","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
