Drawn in 1971 and 1972, these stories expand the prolific artist's vocabulary for characters contextualized by themes of depravity and disorientation in twentieth-century Japan. Some of the tales focus on the devastation the country felt directly as a result of World War II: a prostitute loses all hope when American GIs go home to their wives; a man devotes twenty years of his life to preserving the memory of those killed at Hiroshima, only to discover a horrible misconception at the heart of his tribute. Yet, while American influence does play a role in the disturbing and bizarre stories contained within this volume, it is hardly the overriding theme. A philanthropic foot fetishist, a rash-ridden retiree, and a lonely public onanist are but a few of the characters etching out darkly nuanced lives in the midst of isolated despair and fleeting pleasure.","info":"<li><span>册数: </span>1</li><li><span>话数: </span>9</li><li><span>作者: </span><a href=\"/person/10056\">辰巳ヨシヒロ</a></li><li><span>出版社: </span>Drawn and Quarterly</li><li><span>价格: </span>USD 19.95</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2008年7月8日</li><li><span>页数: </span>208</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":4,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"辰巳ヨシヒロ","count":2},{"name":"漫画","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":10056,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/25/26/10056_prsn_fhkFB.jpg","name":"辰巳嘉裕","desc":"作者"}],"relations":[{"id":105789,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/14/76/105789_3pmv9.jpg","title":"TATSUMI","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/105789"}]}
