Legendary cartoonist Yoshihiro Tatsumi is the grandfather of alternative manga for the adult reader. Predating the advent of the literary graphic novel movement in the United States by thirty years, Tatsumi created a library of literary comics that draws parallels with modern prose fiction and today's alternative comics. Designed and edited by one of today's most popular cartoonists, Adrian Tomine, \"The Push Man and Other Stories\" is the debut volume in a groundbreaking new series that collects Tatsumi's short stories about Japanese urban life. Tatsumi's stories are simultaneously haunting, disturbing, and darkly humorous, commenting on the interplay between an overwhelming, bustling, crowded modern society and the troubled emotional and sexual life of the individual.","info":"<li><span>册数: </span>1</li><li><span>话数: </span>16</li><li><span>作者: </span><a href=\"/person/10056\">辰巳ヨシヒロ</a></li><li><span>出版社: </span>Drawn and Quarterly</li><li><span>价格: </span>USD 19.95</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2005年10月15日</li><li><span>页数: </span>208</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":3,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"辰巳ヨシヒロ","count":1},{"name":"古董","count":1},{"name":"剧画","count":1},{"name":"悲剧","count":1},{"name":"黑暗","count":1},{"name":"人性","count":1},{"name":"漫画","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":10056,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/25/26/10056_prsn_fhkFB.jpg","name":"辰巳嘉裕","desc":"作者"}]}
