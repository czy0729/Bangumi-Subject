{"id":133867,"type":2,"name":"Chowder Season 1","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d0/ed/133867_71SQE.jpg","summary":"Chowder is an American animated television series created by C.H. Greenblatt for Cartoon Network. The series follows an aspiring young chef named Chowder and his day-to-day adventures as an apprentice in Mung Daal's catering company. Although he means well, Chowder often finds himself in predicaments due to his perpetual appetite and his nature as a scatterbrain. He is also pestered by Panini, the apprentice of Mung's rival Endive, who wants Chowder to be her \"boyfriend\", which he abhors. The series is animated with both traditional animation as well as short stop motion puppet sequences that are inter-cut into the episodes, and that run over the end credits.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>爱吃鬼巧达 第一季</li><li><span>话数: </span>20</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2007年11月2日</li><li><span>别名: </span>愛吃鬼巧達</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://chowder.wikia.com/wiki/Chowderpedia</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>Cartoon Network</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2008年7月24日</li><li><span>制片人: </span>Louis J.
