Armoured in faith and armed with the most potent weapons of mankind, these Space Marines stand between humanity and the infernal denizens of the warp. Justicar Alaric is one such warrior, the leader of a squad of these dedicated daemonhunters. When a daemon returns from a millennium of banishment determined to exact revenge upon the Grey Knights for its fall, Alaric is thrust into a war where weapons alone cannot bring victory – faith and will are the keys to survival.","info":"<li><span>出版社: </span>Games Workshop</li><li><span>价格: </span>$15.00</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2009-05-05</li><li><span>页数: </span>768</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>1844166961</li><li><span>作者: </span>Ben Counter</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"relations":[{"id":133865,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ab/c4/133865_07ii8.jpg","title":"The Grey Knights Series","type":"系列","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/133865"}]}
