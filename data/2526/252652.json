Unlike its predecessor Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, released in 1993, The Beast Within was produced entirely in full motion video. The technology was popular at the time of the game's production with the recently introduced storage capabilities of CD-ROMs, but was expensive to produce. Its sequel, Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned used a rendered 3D engine.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>狩魔猎人2：心魔</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/31207\">Sierra Entertainment</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/31207\">Sierra Entertainment</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>心魔：加百利骑士之谜</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>心魔：加百列骑士之谜</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>SCI Engine v2</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995年12月31日</li>","collection":{"wish":2},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"AVG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":31207,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a6/cd/31207_prsn_v4z4M.jpg","name":"雪乐山公司","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":252364,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4c/3f/252364_48xUU.jpg","title":"Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/252364"}]}
