It is generally recognized as one of the first real-time strategy or real-time tactics games.\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Art of War is a real-time strategy game based on the very basic elements of war: unit types, formation, and strength. The game is set in ancient battle-style times before the use of gun powder, consisting of the three basic unit types of that period: the light armored but fast 'barbarians', the heavily armored but slow 'knights', and the ranged 'archers'. A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: 'spies', which is only available under certain campaign rule settings.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>战争上古艺术</li><li><span>别名: </span>戰爭上古藝術</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>上古代戰爭藝術</li><li><span>平台: </span>Macintosh</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC-98</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC-88</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari ST</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amstrad CPC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>DOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Apple II</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RTT/RTS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1984年</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://evryware.com/</li><li><span>开发: </span>Evryware</li><li><span>发行: </span>Broderbund</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Dave Murry, Barry Murry</li>"}
