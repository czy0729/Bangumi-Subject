It is a dual-stick shooter in the same vein as its predecessor, Robotron: 2084 (also produced by Jarvis). As in the previous game, players battle waves of enemies by using guns. The plot of Smash TV revolves around a futuristic game show in which players compete for various prizes as well as their lives.\r\nThe Super NES, Genesis, Master System, and Game Gear versions were titled Super Smash TV.\r\nThe 1992 Williams arcade game Total Carnage shares many elements with Smash TV, and was also programmed by Turmell, but is not a sequel.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>电视斗士</li><li><span>别名: </span>Super Smash TV</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>超级电视斗士</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amstrad CPC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari ST</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>C64</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Master System</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GG</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Multidirectional shooter</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1990年4月</li><li><span>开发: </span>Williams</li><li><span>发行: </span>Williams</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
