It was the first game in the Madden series with an official NFL team license, as well as the first Madden game that allowed players to play a full regular season (via a password system).\r\nIt was the first Madden game to use the famous \"EA Sports – It's in the Game\" audio tag. It also introduced the \"Flip play\", \"Play-call mode\", \"Pass-catch mode\" and \"Bluff play\" options to the series. This was the first Madden title to pause the action and rotate the screen during punts, kickoffs and turnovers, rather than instantly reversing P.O.V. to the opposite side of the field, which could be disorienting to players. The field could also be rotated to view plays from any angle in instant replay.\r\nThis was also the first of the Madden games to have Super Bowl teams available for play without any special codes.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>麦登橄榄球94</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Madden 94'</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>劲爆美式橄榄球94</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>约翰麦登橄榄球94</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>职业橄榄球94</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年11月19日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Visual Concepts</li>","staff":[{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"艺电","desc":"发行"}]}
