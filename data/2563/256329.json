It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The project leader for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.\r\nThe game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>劲爆NBA篮球</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32718\">Midway Games</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32718\">Midway Games</a></li><li><span>制作总指挥: </span><a href=\"/person/36797\">Vince Zampella</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>NBA嘉年华</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>NBAジャム</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>NBA Jam: Tournament Edition</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GG</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GB</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mega-CD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SS (Tournament Edition)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS (Tournament Edition)</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年</li>","staff":[{"id":32718,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/14/80/32718_prsn_HD7Yl.jpg","name":"Midway Games","desc":"开发"},{"id":36797,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/e6/88/36797_prsn_pu6Ek.jpg","name":"文斯·赞佩拉","desc":"制作总指挥"}]}
