He was in no condition to fight. He was sick, really sick. His disease had whittled him down to a shadow of his former self. He was crippled from a car accident when he was 17 but that's not how he lost his big toe. He lost that in a motorbike accident, yeah he was broken alright - what the hell was he fighting for anyway and what was he still doing in China? His father had given me two clear instructions: 1. Get Techno to stop drinking long enough to receive the liver transplant, and 2. Get him back home to Vancouver. This was not going to be easy.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>梨酒与香烟</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2016年7月1日</li><li><span>片长: </span>35分钟</li><li><span>导演: </span>Robert Valley</li>","collection":{"wish":5,"collect":6,"on_hold":3,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"2016","count":5},{"name":"短片","count":2},{"name":"头弃","count":1},{"name":"美国","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":875440,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/875440","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
