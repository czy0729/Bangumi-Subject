The game is set in 2000, before the implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme to curb the blood diamond trade, and the player's aim is to extract diamonds from Angola over the nine turns which comprise a game. To extract the most diamonds and win, players resort to a combination of bribery and deception.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>伦敦钻石交易</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Strategy</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>singleplayer, multiplayer</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2012/8/28</li><li><span>Developer: </span>Jason Rohrer</li><li><span>Publisher: </span>indiePub</li>"}
