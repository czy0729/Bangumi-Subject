{"id":241708,"type":2,"name":"The Poet and Peasant","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/98/ca/241708_vUQQ9.jpg","summary":"　　Andy Panda conducts the \"Hollywood Washbowl Orchestra\" (an ensemble of farm animals, on a farm) in the title tune. After Andy removes a frog from under his wig, he begins. All is well until his shirt gets stuck on a nail; while he's fighting it, the orchestra breaks into a swinging tune. Back under control, a talkative squirrel in the audience annoys the pig sitting next to him; the pig zips the squirrel's mouth shut. A bird lands on Andy's baton; he waves it, and 2, 3, 4, and 5 birds appear (apparently, his baton's become a magic wand). He waves some more, and the birds disappear one by one, finally replaced with a very happy cat. Two ducks dance as ballerinas; then one fox and one duck, but the second duck is not as easily captured.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>诗人和农夫</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1945</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧 / 动画 / 短片 / 音乐 / 家庭</li><li><span>导演: </span>Dick Lundy</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Ben Hardaway / Milt Schaffer</li><li><span>IMDb: </span>tt0037994</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
