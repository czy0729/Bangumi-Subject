The game, released on October 25, 2012, has been described as a spoof of the edutainment game genre. In the game, the player begins by controlling a frog to eat bugs and defend fruit. Later on, the player may spend points on upgrades to improve their frog's abilities. The game does not actually teach the player about fractions; the player's score is given in fractions, but no knowledge of them is necessary to play.\r\n\r\nIts sequel Frog Fractions 2, announced by a Kickstarter in 2014, was released in December 2016 after players successfully completed a multi-segmented alternative reality game assembled by Crawford. The first game was later ported to Windows and released on Steam in August 2020 as Frog Fractions: Game of the Decade Edition, along with downloadable content that adds a new playable story.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>青蛙分数</li><li><span>别名: </span>Frog Fractions: Game of the Decade Edition</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>青蛙分数：十年版</li><li><span>平台: </span>Web browser</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Indie</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2012年10月25日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://twinbeard.com/frog-fractions/</li><li><span>开发: </span>Twinbeard Studios</li><li><span>发行: </span>Twinbeard Studios</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":8},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":4},{"name":"flash","count":3},{"name":"独立游戏","count":3},{"name":"ETC","count":2}]}
