{"id":198295,"type":6,"name":"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia Season 1","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/bd/3c/198295_YFz4T.jpg","summary":"This season, the gang inadvertently turns Paddy's Pub into a gay bar after one of Sweet Dee's acting class members invites his gay friends over to drink while Mac and Charlie try to prove to Charlie's crush that they are not prejudiced against African Americans. Then Charlie becomes a father when an old flame reveals that the son she has is his—and Charlie attempts to get a paternity test at a free clinic but the old flame reveals that is not true, while Mac and Dennis frequent pro- and anti-abortion rallies to pick up women. The gang then turns their bar into a safe haven for underage drinkers—and find themselves regressing to their high school ways when they get invited to the prom. Charlie has a cancer scare and the gang looks for a woman to sleep with him before he dies.\r\n\r\nThe gang then gets gun-crazy when their bar has been robbed and Dee dates a man who may be the culprit. Following that, the gang finds a dead man in one of their booths and Dee and Dennis visit their ailing (Nazi) grandfather at a nursing home. Finally, Charlie is suspected of being a victim of child molestation when a former gym teacher is accused of sexually molesting his students—and Mac is livid that he wasn't one of the victims.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>费城永远阳光灿烂 第一季</li><li><span>别名: </span>费城阳光</li><li><span>集数: </span>7</li><li><span>开始: </span>August 4, 2005</li><li><span>结束: </span>September 15, 2005</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>30min</li><li><span>电视网: </span>FX</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0472954</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"FX","count":1},{"name":"美剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":678185,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678185","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678186,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678186","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678187,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678187","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678188,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678188","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678189,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678189","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678190,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678190","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678191,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678191","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
