Places filled with danger and foreboding where no ordinary man would dare to journey. However, there are a few who are willing to risk death in the name of good, in the name of justice, in the name of.. valuable loot! \r\n\r\nHack, Slash, Loot is a single-player turn-based dungeon crawler.

With a new dungeon created every game you can be sure that no two playthroughs will ever be the same. Boasting easy to master controls you'll be adventuring in no time, but there is still enough depth to challenge the most hardened of adventurers.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>地牢大冒险</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Rogue-like</li><li><span>开发: </span>Gooey Blob</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2012-01-23</li><li><span>售价: </span>$6.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>hackslashloot.com</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
