Players from around the world will compete in frenetic online matches with up to 64 players simultaneously. Bombers will be placed at random starting points before being let loose on a bombing frenzy against other players. As time ticks away, areas will begin to close, forcing you to scramble to the other remaining areas before the timer runs out. Blast away all your rivals and be the last one standing!\r\n\r\nPrepare to head into battle as one of the Eight Bomberman Bros. with numerous characters (including those from Super Bomberman R and other Konami IPs) to come later. The game features greater customization options, costumes, accessories and for the first time, bomb skins—affecting both the bomb and the blast itself.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>超级炸弹人R 在线</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>スーパーボンバーマン R オンライン</li><li><span>平台: </span>Stadia</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2020年9月1日(Stadia)</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.konami.com/games/bomberman/online/us/en/</li>","staff":[{"id":747,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/c1/747_prsn_43cah.jpg","name":"科乐美","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":206179,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/cd/0a/206179_1oQz9.jpg","title":"SUPER BOMBERMAN R","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/206179"}]}
