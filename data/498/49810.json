Bones的创作灵感来源于法庭人类学家和长篇小说家Kathy Reichs的真实生活。主人公Brennan博士是一名法庭人类学家，为杰斐逊协会工作，并以写作小说为副业，因有着特殊的才能，能根据受害者的尸骨找到常人难以发现的线索。而被法院强制她协助警方侦破那些因尸体严重腐烂、烧毁或被破坏而使得普通的尸检方法无能为力的凶杀案件。 \r\nBrennnan在杰斐逊协会法医学实验室有着同样出色的才华的同事们，包括：喜欢泡帅哥的Angela Montenegro，她能用三维图象模拟再现原始犯罪现场。Brennan的助手Zack Addy，他的智商高得吓人，同时拿下了好几个博士头衔。Jack Hodgins是昆虫、孢子和矿石方面的专家，但却喜欢耍阴谋诡计。还有Brennan的老板，实验室主任Camille Saroyan博士。 \r\nBrennan经常与特别探员Seeley Booth打交道，Booth曾是一名军队的狙击手，在破案时对科学和科学家并不信任。Brennan和Booth在工作和生活中经常发生摩擦，但戏剧性的是，不是冤家不碰头，两人之间最后竟奇妙地擦出了火花。 \r\n在骄傲背后Brennan有着一段不同寻常的家庭惨剧。母亲被人谋杀，父亲离奇失踪，这些回忆如梦魇般缠绕了她15年。她终于追踪到了凶案背后的蛛丝马迹，在Booth的帮助下Brennan将拼尽全力找寻那个令她痛苦一生的真凶","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>识骨寻踪 第八季</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>周二</li><li><span>配角:
