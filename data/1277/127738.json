But when Mike, Carol, AND Chrissy have no place to go when Kate is at a spa, Scott is out on a campaign, and Chrissy claims to have got evicted, what's going to happen? Well Jason and Maggie were originally going to sell the house to a childhood friend of Mike and Carol's....Richie Flanscopper. And guess who the realtor is....BEN! Ben is dead set on selling this house, but the rest of the Seaver kids aren't so keen on the idea. Due to this, Mike and Carol (who's pregnant), take matters into their own hands and sabotage the house so their little brother can't sell it to Richie and his wife Fiona. Meanwhile, Mike's oldest Michelle, is sad about her dad going to Tokyo, for a job promotion, while the rest of the kids, haven't a thought about it. Close to the end, Ben realizes his younger and older siblings and mother and father really do not want to sell the house so he makes the house unsellable. He drives Mike's car through the garage door, and Fiona and Richie decide to not buy the house. All Seavers rejoice, except Carol who all of a sudden goes into labor. At the end of the movie Carol's son is born. They named him Seaver Malone Johnson. And it's a happy ending for everyone.\r\n\r\n　　Jason和Maggie在《成长的烦恼2：希瓦一家的归来》中准备开始他们生活新的一章。他们决定卖掉他们的房子，并准备去旅行来度过他们的退休生活（Maggie一直渴望去Tuscany的别墅，而一向节省的Jason希望在一辆 Winnebago房车里去环游美国）。但是一切都是说起来容易做起来难。Mike和已经怀孕的Carol为了各自的事情一起合伙阻止这次父母的离开；此时，小儿子Ben（一个房地产经纪人），需要靠卖掉他父母这幢房子的生意来取悦他的老板。同时，Chrissie，一个充满渴望的歌手，只想能够从父母的严密管束下脱离出来而开启她的摇滚明星的职业生涯。现在故事刚刚开始............","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>成长的烦恼：希瓦家归来</li><li><span>集数: </span>1</li><li><span>开始: </span>2004-10-16</li><li><span>类型: </span>电影</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>每集长: </span>120min</li><li><span>频道: </span>ABC</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0403087</li><li><span>发行人: </span>Warner Bros.
