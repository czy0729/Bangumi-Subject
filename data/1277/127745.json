Charlotte is now happily married to Harry Goldenblatt, but she had a hard time getting pregnant - so they adopted a Chinese girl named Lily; Miranda has settled down in Brooklyn with Steve (David Eigenberg) to raise their son Brady together; and Samantha has relocated her business to Los Angeles to be close to Smith (Jason Lewis), who is now a superstar, although she misses her old life and takes every opportunity to fly East to be with Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte.\r\n\r\nCarrie herself is now in a relationship with Big (Chris Noth), and they are viewing apartments with plans to move in together. Carrie falls in love with a penthouse far from their price range. Big immediately agrees to pay for it. Carrie offers to sell her own apartment, although she also voices her fear that she would have no legal rights to their home in case they separate, as they are not married. To quell her fears, Big suggests that they marry. Carrie announces the news to her friends. Charlotte and Miranda are happy at the news, but Samantha - as Carrie points out dryly - sounds more excited at the thought of Carrie \"finally getting Botox\". Charlotte suggests her longtime gay friend, Anthony Marantino, as the pushy wedding planner.\r\n\r\nMiranda confesses to her friends that she has been so busy she hasn’t had sex with Steve in six months. When Steve confesses he has cheated on her, Miranda is devastated and immediately separates from him. At Carrie and Big's rehearsal dinner, Steve tries to reconcile with Miranda, but she rebuffs him. Still upset with Steve, she tells Big bluntly that marriage ruins everything.\r\n\r\nOn the wedding day, (partially due to Miranda's words at the rehearsal dinner) Big is too fearful to go through with the ceremony. Carrie, devastated, flees the wedding. Samantha stays behind to clear the guests. Big changes his mind and catches up with Carrie in an attempt to reconcile in the middle of a one-way street. Carrie furiously attacks him with her bouquet while he earns scathing looks from Miranda and Charlotte, as well as from the crowds of New Yorkers watching the scene unfold. To console Carrie (who is depressed, and at the beginning of the holiday doesn't eat anything for two days), the four women take the honeymoon that Carrie had booked to Mexico, where they de-stress and collect themselves.\r\n\r\nUpon returning to New York, Carrie hires an assistant, Louise (Jennifer Hudson), to help her manage her life. Miranda eventually confesses to Carrie about what happened at the rehearsal dinner, and the two briefly fall out as Carrie storms out of a restaurant on Valentine's Day. After reflecting on the argument she had with Carrie, Miranda agrees to attend couples counseling with Steve, and they are eventually able to reconcile. Samantha finds her five-year-old relationship passionless, and begins over-eating to keep from cheating on Smith with a gorgeous neighbour, Dante. She eventually decides to say farewell to Smith and moves back to New York. Around the same time, Louise quits her job as Carrie's assistant to get married and move back permanently to her hometown of St Louis.\r\n\r\nCharlotte learns she is pregnant, and for most of her pregnancy is fearful that something might happen to her baby, so she stops her regular running around Central Park. Carrie puts her fear to rest by telling her that, since she already soiled herself in Mexico, her bad luck is finished. Later, Charlotte has a surprise encounter with Big that leaves her so outraged that her water breaks. Big takes her to the hospital and waits until baby Rose is born, hoping to see Carrie. Harry passes on the message that Big would like her to call him, and that he has written to her frequently, but never received a reply. Carrie searches her correspondence and finds in Louise's personal assistant file that he has sent her dozens of letters copied from the book she read him before their wedding, culminating with one of his own where he apologizes for screwing up and promises to love her forever.\r\n\r\nCarrie travels to the exquisite penthouse Big had bought for them to collect a pair of brand new Manolo Blahnik shoes (that later become one of the icons of the movie) that she had left there. She finds Big in the walk-in closet he had built for her, and the moment she sees him, her anger at his betrayal dissipates. They share a passionate kiss, and Big proposes to Carrie properly, using one of her diamond-encrusted shoes in place of a ring. They later marry alone, in a simple wedding in New York City Hall, with Carrie wearing the simple suit that she had intended to wear before being enticed away by the Vivienne Westwood dress that she had modelled in the bridal issue of Vogue. Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte turn up to surprise Carrie, having been called by Big. The film ends with the four women sipping cosmopolitans, celebrating Samantha's fiftieth birthday, with Carrie making a toast to the next fifty.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>欲望都市 电影版</li><li><span>主演: </span>Sarah Jessica Parker、<a href=\"/person/41557\">Kim Cattrall</a>、Kristin Davis、Cynthia Nixon、Chris Noth、Jennifer Hudson、Candice Bergen</li><li><span>制作: </span><a href=\"/person/38628\">HBO</a></li><li><span>集数: </span>1</li><li><span>开始: </span>2008-05-12</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>147min</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt1000774</li><li><span>导演: </span>Michael Patrick King</li><li><span>制片人/制作人: </span>Michael Patrick King、Sarah Jessica Parker、Darren Star、John Melfi</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Michael Patrick King</li><li><span>原作: </span>Candace Bushnell《Sex and the City 》、Darren Star<Sex and the City ></li><li><span>旁白: </span>Sarah Jessica Parker</li><li><span>音乐: </span>Aaron Zigman</li><li><span>摄影: </span>John Thomas</li><li><span>剪辑: </span>Michael Berenbaum</li><li><span>制作公司: </span>HBO Films</li><li><span>发行: </span>New Line Cinema</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"doing":2},"eps":[{"id":498188,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/498188","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":41557,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/88/3b/41557_prsn_28DvX.jpg","name":"金·凯特罗尔","desc":"主演"},{"id":38628,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/04/49/38628_prsn_MOomu.jpg","name":"HBO电视网","desc":"制作"}],"relations":[{"id":127751,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f0/95/127751_4Q7lD.jpg","title":"Sex and the City 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/127751"},{"id":76817,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e2/88/76817_TqH52.jpg","title":"Sex and the City Season 1","type":"番外篇","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/76817"}]}
