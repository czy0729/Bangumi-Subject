Immediately. Because - if you're in the UK at least - you'll want to be in front of the telly, watching the extended, all-new Top Gear episode that'll wrap up Series 22.\r\n\r\nFeaturing a pair of previously unseen films shot for the most recent series, plus studio links from Richard and James, the one-off will air on BBC Two at 8pm.\r\n\r\nThe first film sees Jeremy, Richard and James living the lifestyle of traditional classic car buffs, acquiring a Fiat 124 Spyder, Peugeot 304 Cabriolet and MGB GT before setting off an adventure incorporating brown beer, breakdowns (inevitably) and attending a car show where everything goes wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you're thinking ‘unlikely to end well', you're not alone. Have a flick through the pictures above for a flavour of what's in store.\r\n\r\nIn the second film, our intrepid trio attempt to become ‘lifestyle leisure enthusiasts' with the help of some very ratty old 4x4s.\r\n\r\nArmed with a budget of just £250, the boys each purchase a high-mileage, low-quality SUV - Clarkson a Vauxhall Frontera, Hammond a Jeep Cherokee and May a Mitsubishi Shogun Pinin - before embarking on a series of gruelling challenges, including a battle with the Stig's Leisure Activity Cousin, which climaxes with a race that has a terrifying penalty for the person who loses.\r\n\r\nIt all airs in the UK at 8pm on Sunday June 28, BBC2. To pass the time until then, check out the episode trailer below.\r\n\r\nFor international fans please check your local TV listings for scheduling information in your country.","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":95648,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/97/a8/95648_FaHAi.jpg","title":"Top Gear Season 21","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/95648"},{"id":117104,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/59/08/117104_zes51.jpg","title":"Top Gear The Perfect Road Trip 2","type":"番外篇","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/117104"}]}
