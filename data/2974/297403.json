It is an open-world game, more akin to a RPG than a roguelike, wherein the world is partially pre-made and partially randomly generated. The game features a mix between a post-apocalyptic and a fantasy setting, and is heavily inspired by the pen-and-paper role-playing game Gamma World and Dungeons & Dragons.\r\n\r\nWhile some rate the game as being more accessible compared to other roguelikes, other reviews find the game's interface confusing and are deterred by the lack of an in-depth tutorial.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OSX</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2015年7月15日</li><li><span>售价: </span>¥ 50</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>www.cavesofqud.com</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"roguelike","count":2},{"name":"Rougelike","count":1},{"name":"2015","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"STEAM","count":1}]}
