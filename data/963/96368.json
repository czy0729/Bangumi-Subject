He is often taunted by his more successful work colleagues, and his ideas are dismissed by egotistical entrepreneur Erlich Bachman, who owns the technology development incubator where Richard lives with fellow programmers Nelson \"Big Head\" Bighetti, Bertram Gilfoyle and Dinesh Chugtai. However when Hooli stumbles upon the music copyright service that Richard is working on, entitled Pied Piper, they discover that hidden within the useless application is the best file compression algorithm in the world, and news spreads quickly. Eventually Richard is caught between a $10 million buyout by Hooli CEO Gavin Belson, and a $200,000 investment from eccentric billionaire Peter Gregory, and must decide whether to give up his program to the highest bidder or to take the investment and create a business out of it himself. After having a panic attack and vomiting on the street, Richard runs into Peter's assistant Monica, who tells him that she believes in him and his idea, and he decides to take the investment and run the business himself.","status":"Air"},{"id":391211,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/391211","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"The Cap Table","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-04-13","comment":0,"desc":"After rejecting Belson's offer and siding with Peter Gregory, Richard is overwhelmed by the amount of work that needs to be done in establishing the business to Gregory's satisfaction. Luckily, Belson's former PA, Jared Dunn, arrives at the incubator, begging Richard to hire him, as he sees huge potential in the Pied Piper idea, and is hired due to his business expertise. However, in evaluating the Pied Piper team, Jared discovers that while Gilfoyle and Dinesh are brilliant coders, Big Head is comparatively mediocre, and Richard is pressured by everyone to fire him as he brings nothing to the table. After much arguing, Richard refuses to do so, but Big Head announces that he was given a huge raise and promotion at Hooli, as Gavin Belson wants to publicize Big Head as co-founder of Pied Piper. Later, Big Head tells Richard that work has begun on reverse-engineering Pied Piper to create the same product, branded under a different name.","status":"Air"},{"id":391212,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/391212","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Articles of Incorporation","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-04-20","comment":0,"desc":"Richard and Jared discover that the Pied Piper business name is already in use by an irrigation enterprise in Gilroy, California. While Jared, Dinesh and Gilfoyle begin brainstorming new names for the application, Erlich decides to find a name by setting off on a vision quest at Sonora Desert, which results in Erlich having a panic attack after consuming hallucinogenic mushrooms. Adamant on keeping the original name, Richard attempts to prove that he is a good negotiator by convincing the irrigation company to give up the name Pied Piper. Initially the company's owner asks for a small amount of money but after reading about the technology's success on the web, he asks for a lot more. After confronting him, Richard manages to keep the name for almost the original price, while Erlich, still in the aftermath of his vision quest, returns with a child by his side, convinced he has found another version of himself. Meanwhile, Peter Gregory becomes obsessed with Burger King products, leaving his assistant Monica in a difficult position with some of their clients, who need an urgent cash injection or risk firing hundreds of people. Taking his time, Gregory ends up investing in sesame seed production, earning a huge profit in stock and solving the situation to Monica's and their associates' relief.","status":"Air"},{"id":391213,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/391213","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Fiduciary Duties","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-04-27","comment":1,"desc":"Peter assigns an attorney, Ron, to the Pied Piper venture, who accidentally lets slip that Richard's project is only one of eight file compression suites that Peter invests in. This impacts Richard, who suddenly panics that he has no sense of where the company should go and what it should be doing. Meanwhile, Big Head is removed from Hooli's copycat compression software project, named Nucleus, because of his complete lack of understanding of what Richard actually did to create Pied Piper, and is not reassigned to anything, joining the other unassigned employees that spend their days doing nothing on the company's roof. During a toga party organized by Gregory, Erlich is mistakenly appointed to the Pied Piper board of directors when Richard gets drunk. Richard initially reverses the decision, but after Erlich elaborates during a meeting about Pied Piper's direction causing Peter to continue funding, Richard permanently appoints him on the board.","status":"Air"},{"id":391214,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/391214","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Signaling Risk","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-05-04","comment":3,"desc":"Erlich hires a convicted felon and graffiti artist, Chuy, to create a new logo for Pied Piper and to paint it on the incubator garage, but Chuy's creation depicts Dinesh having sexual intercourse with the Statue of Liberty because he believes Dinesh is of Latin descent.

Richard suggests withdrawing from the Battlefield, but Belson beats him to it and announces the release of Nucleus will take place at the Battlefield, and due to Peter's intense rivalry with Belson, he refuses to allow Pied Piper to withdraw and tells them to have a finished demo for the Battlefield in eight weeks, instead of the initial five months.","status":"Air"},{"id":391215,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/391215","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Third Party Insourcing","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-05-11","comment":7,"desc":"Pied Piper is nearing completion, but Richard is having serious issues coding the cloud-based integration modules for the application, so much so that Jared, Gilfoyle, Erlich and Dinesh pressure him into hiring Kevin \"The Carver\", an Adderall-addicted teenaged programmer with a specialty in cloud integration.

Jared suggests pivoting the company, which results in him being arrested by the police after an incident involving Adderall. The PP team retreats to their hotel room where they mock up a mathematical model for Erlich to give handjobs to every male in the Battlefield audience instead of doing their presentation, which gives Richard an epiphany about compression algorithms. He stays up all night, deletes most of the Pied Piper features and leaves only one – the all-important compression engine, which, using Richard's brand new compression code, achieves a Weissman score of 5.2. Pied Piper wins the Battlefield, embarrassing Belson and Hooli. After learning from Monica, amidst some flirting between the two, that Pied Piper will be fielding business interests and that things will only get harder, Richard has another panic attack and vomits into a dumpster in the alley.","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":38628,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/04/49/38628_prsn_MOomu.jpg","name":"HBO电视网","desc":"制作"}],"relations":[{"id":130973,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/be/71/130973_9CO2e.jpg","title":"Silicon Valley (Season 2)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/130973"}]}
