Mae is a rabbit-eared genius programmer, able to manipulate reality with a few keystrokes or - the more fun option - blow up large swathes of reality in one of her custom-built Devices. However, genius is never understood in its own time, and she's provoked a severe response from the environmental group \"Blue Revolver\". Command her defiant counter-attack over 5 stages of manic struggle, blast through hordes of enemies and go face-to-face with fearsome bosses. \r\nFeatures:\r\n5 stages of heart-pounding struggle. Snowy mountains, hectic dockyards, nightmare bases and more... \r\nTwo pilots with 3 gun types each, and 8 special weapons to choose from! Blocking bullets, clearing crowds, carving up bosses or milking points - the choice is yours. \r\nAdaptive difficulty system - the game tailors its difficulty on the fly to your skill level. Or if you're weird, pick Parallel mode for a glimpse of the most the game can throw at you, including a \"nice\" surprise at the end. \r\nMissions mode - 24 single-stage challenges allow you to build up your skills before going for the full clear! Take on strict survival and scoring challenges, or deal with slightly stranger things - experimental weapons, annoying giant bullets and more. \r\nFlourish for high scores! Build up short chains and finish them off with the special weapon for big points. Score BREAK bonuses by picking apart bosses and big enemies in difficult ways. \r\nFull original soundtrack by Qygen and Novaturtle - and tons of usable remix tracks by Exemia, Hyphen, MadDrift, Terranaut, Mitomoro, Blue Phoenix, ikaruga_nex and Aghast. \r\nUnlock gallery art, remix tracks and other goodies as you play. \r\nScreen scaling options (including portrait mode), rebindable controls, \"kiosk mode\" for parties or events.\r\nPlease note: achievements, leaderboards and replay support are coming in a post-launch update. \r\n","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>蓝色手轮</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>纵版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2016年10月11日</li><li><span>售价: </span>￥48</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://store.steampowered.com/app/439490</li><li><span>开发: </span>Stellar Circle</li><li><span>发行: </span>Stellar Circle</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}]}
