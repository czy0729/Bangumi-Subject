Bumbling Peter and long-suffering Lois have three kids. Stewie (a brilliant but sadistic baby bent on killing his mother and taking over the world), Meg (the oldest, and is the most unpopular girl in town) and Chris (the middle kid, he's not very bright but has a passion for movies). The final member of the family is Brian - a talking dog and much more than a pet, he keeps Stewie in check whilst sipping Martinis and sorting through his own life issues.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>恶搞之家 第三季</li><li><span>话数: </span>22</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2001年7月12日</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>FOX</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2003年11月3日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":7,"doing":1,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"冷门","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":487415,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487415","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"The Thin White Line","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-7-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487416,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487416","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Brian Does Hollywood","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-7-19","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487417,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487417","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-7-26","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487418,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487418","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"One if by Clam, Two if by Sea","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-8-2","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487419,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487419","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"And the Wiener is...","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-8-9","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487420,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487420","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Death Lives","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-8-16","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487421,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487421","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Lethal Weapons","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-8-23","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487422,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487422","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"The Kiss Seen Round the World","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-8-30","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487423,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487423","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Mr. Saturday Knight","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-9-6","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487424,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487424","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Fish Out of Water","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-9-13","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487425,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487425","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Emission Impossible","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-11-9","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487426,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487426","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"To Love and Die in Dixie","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-11-16","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487427,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487427","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"Screwed the Pooch","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-11-30","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487428,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487428","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"Peter Griffin: Husband, Father...Brother?","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-12-7","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487429,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487429","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"Ready, Willing, and Disabled","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-12-21","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487430,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487430","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2001-12-22","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487431,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487431","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2002-1-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487432,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487432","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"From Method to Madness","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2002-1-25","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487433,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487433","type":0,"sort":19,"name":"Stuck Together, Torn Apart","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2002-2-1","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487434,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487434","type":0,"sort":20,"name":"Road to Europe","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2002-2-8","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487435,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487435","type":0,"sort":21,"name":"Family Guy Viewer Mail #1","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2002-2-15","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487436,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487436","type":0,"sort":22,"name":"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2003-11-3","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":126503,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e1/81/126503_bS8Ny.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 2)","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126503"},{"id":126505,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/65/d1/126505_b1T0d.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 4)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126505"}]}
