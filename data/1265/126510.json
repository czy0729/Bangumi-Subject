Bumbling Peter and long-suffering Lois have three kids. Stewie (a brilliant but sadistic baby bent on killing his mother and taking over the world), Meg (the oldest, and is the most unpopular girl in town) and Chris (the middle kid, he's not very bright but has a passion for movies). The final member of the family is Brian - a talking dog and much more than a pet, he keeps Stewie in check whilst sipping Martinis and sorting through his own life issues.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>恶搞之家 第九季</li><li><span>话数: </span>18</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2010年9月27日</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>FOX</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2011年5月23日</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":7,"dropped":2},"eps":[{"id":487534,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487534","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"And Then There Were Fewer","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-9-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487535,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487535","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Excellence in Broadcasting","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-10-4","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487536,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487536","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Welcome Back Carter","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-10-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487537,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487537","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Halloween on Spooner Street","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-11-8","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487538,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487538","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Baby, You Knock Me Out","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-11-15","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487539,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487539","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Brian Writes a Bestseller","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-11-22","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487540,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487540","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Road to the North Pole","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-12-13","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487541,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487541","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"New Kidney in Town","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-1-10","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487542,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487542","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"And I'm Joyce Kinney","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-1-17","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487543,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487543","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Friends of Peter G","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-2-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487544,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487544","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"German Guy","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-2-21","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487545,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487545","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-3-7","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487546,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487546","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"Trading Places","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-3-21","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487547,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487547","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"Tiegs for Two","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-4-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487548,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487548","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"Brothers & Sisters","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-4-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487549,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487549","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"The Big Bang Theory","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-5-9","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487550,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487550","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"Foreign Affairs","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-5-16","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487551,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487551","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"It's a Trap!","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-5-23","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":126509,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/1b/62/126509_oG33v.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 8)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126509"},{"id":126511,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b7/f3/126511_B0vYQ.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 10)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126511"}]}
