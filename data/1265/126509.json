Bumbling Peter and long-suffering Lois have three kids. Stewie (a brilliant but sadistic baby bent on killing his mother and taking over the world), Meg (the oldest, and is the most unpopular girl in town) and Chris (the middle kid, he's not very bright but has a passion for movies). The final member of the family is Brian - a talking dog and much more than a pet, he keeps Stewie in check whilst sipping Martinis and sorting through his own life issues.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>恶搞之家 第八季</li><li><span>话数: </span>21</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2009年9月28日</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>FOX</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2010年6月21日</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":7,"dropped":1},"eps":[{"id":487513,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487513","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Road to the Multiverse","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2009-9-28","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487514,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487514","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Family Goy","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2009-10-5","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487515,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487515","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Spies Reminiscent of Us","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2009-10-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487516,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487516","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Brian's Got a Brand New Bag","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2009-11-9","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487517,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487517","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Hannah Banana","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2009-11-9","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487518,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487518","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Quagmire's Baby","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2009-11-16","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487519,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487519","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Jerome is the New Black","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2009-11-23","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487520,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487520","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Dog Gone","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2009-11-30","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487521,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487521","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Business Guy","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2009-12-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487522,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487522","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Big Man on Hippocampus","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-1-4","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487523,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487523","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Dial Meg for Murder","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-2-1","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487524,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487524","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Extra Large Medium","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-2-15","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487525,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487525","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"Go, Stewie, Go!","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-3-15","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487526,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487526","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"Peter-assment","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-3-22","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487527,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487527","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"Brian Griffin's House of Payne","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-3-29","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487528,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487528","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"April in Quahog","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-4-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487529,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487529","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"Brian & Stewie","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-5-3","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487530,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487530","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"Quagmire's Dad","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-5-10","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487531,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487531","type":0,"sort":19,"name":"The Splendid Source","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-5-17","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487532,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487532","type":0,"sort":20,"name":"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-5-24","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487533,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487533","type":0,"sort":21,"name":"Partial Terms of Endearment","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2010-6-21","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":126508,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3c/df/126508_SzYbS.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 7)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126508"},{"id":126510,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/82/2e/126510_nY6Yc.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 9)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126510"}]}
