Bumbling Peter and long-suffering Lois have three kids. Stewie (a brilliant but sadistic baby bent on killing his mother and taking over the world), Meg (the oldest, and is the most unpopular girl in town) and Chris (the middle kid, he's not very bright but has a passion for movies). The final member of the family is Brian - a talking dog and much more than a pet, he keeps Stewie in check whilst sipping Martinis and sorting through his own life issues.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>恶搞之家 第五季</li><li><span>话数: </span>18</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2006年9月11日</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>FOX</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2007年5月21日</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":7,"dropped":1},"eps":[{"id":487467,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487467","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Stewie Loves Lois","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2006-9-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487468,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487468","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Mother Tucker","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2006-9-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487469,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487469","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Hell Comes to Quahog","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2006-9-25","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487470,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487470","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Saving Private Brian","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2006-11-6","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487471,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487471","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Whistle While Your Wife Works","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2006-11-13","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487472,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487472","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Prick Up Your Ears","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2006-11-20","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487473,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487473","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Chick Cancer","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2006-11-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487474,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487474","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Barely Legal","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2006-12-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487475,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487475","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Road to Rupert","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-1-29","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487476,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487476","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Peter's Two Dads","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-2-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487477,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487477","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"The Tan Aquatic With Steve Zissou","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-2-19","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487478,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487478","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Airport '07","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-3-5","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487479,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487479","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-3-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487480,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487480","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"No Meals On Wheels","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-3-26","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487481,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487481","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"Boys Do Cry","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-4-30","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487482,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487482","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"No Chris Left Behind","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-5-7","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487483,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487483","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"It Takes a Village Idiot... and I Married One","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-5-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487484,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487484","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"Meet the Quagmires","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-5-21","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":126505,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/65/d1/126505_b1T0d.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 4)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126505"},{"id":126507,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/23/bf/126507_TriRK.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 6)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126507"}]}
