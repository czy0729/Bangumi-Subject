Bumbling Peter and long-suffering Lois have three kids. Stewie (a brilliant but sadistic baby bent on killing his mother and taking over the world), Meg (the oldest, and is the most unpopular girl in town) and Chris (the middle kid, he's not very bright but has a passion for movies). The final member of the family is Brian - a talking dog and much more than a pet, he keeps Stewie in check whilst sipping Martinis and sorting through his own life issues.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>恶搞之家 第十二季</li><li><span>话数: </span>21</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2013年9月30日</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>FOX</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2014年5月19日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":7,"on_hold":1,"dropped":2},"eps":[{"id":487575,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487575","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Finders Keepers","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2013-9-30","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487576,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487576","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Vestigial Peter","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2013-10-7","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487577,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487577","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Quagmire's Quagmire","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2013-11-4","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487578,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487578","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"A Fistful of Meg","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2013-11-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487579,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487579","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Boopa-dee Bappa-dee","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2013-11-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487580,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487580","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Life of Brian","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2013-11-25","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487581,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487581","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Into Harmony's Way","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2013-12-9","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487582,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487582","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Christmas Guy","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2013-12-16","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487583,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487583","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Peter Problems","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-1-6","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487584,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487584","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Grimm Job","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-1-13","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487585,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487585","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Brian's a Bad Father","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-1-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487586,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487586","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Mom's the Word","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-3-10","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487587,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487587","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"3 Acts of God","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-3-17","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487588,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487588","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"Fresh Heir","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-3-24","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487589,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487589","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"Secondhand Spoke","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-3-31","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487590,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487590","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"Herpe, the Love Sore","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-4-7","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487591,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487591","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"The Most Interesting Man in the World","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-4-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487592,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487592","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"Baby Got Black","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-4-28","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487593,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487593","type":0,"sort":19,"name":"Meg Stinks!","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-5-5","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487594,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487594","type":0,"sort":20,"name":"He's Bla-ack","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-5-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487595,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487595","type":0,"sort":21,"name":"Chap Stewie","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-5-19","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":50159,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5e/cf/50159_4GO0Y.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 11)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/50159"},{"id":126513,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/8f/b9/126513_c8414.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 13)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126513"}]}
