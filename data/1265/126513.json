Bumbling Peter and long-suffering Lois have three kids. Stewie (a brilliant but sadistic baby bent on killing his mother and taking over the world), Meg (the oldest, and is the most unpopular girl in town) and Chris (the middle kid, he's not very bright but has a passion for movies). The final member of the family is Brian - a talking dog and much more than a pet, he keeps Stewie in check whilst sipping Martinis and sorting through his own life issues.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>恶搞之家 第十三季</li><li><span>话数: </span>13</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2014年9月29日</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>FOX</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2015年3月16日</li>","collection":{"wish":4,"collect":9,"dropped":3},"tags":[{"name":"2014","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":487596,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487596","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"The Simpsons Guy","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-9-29","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487597,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487597","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"The Book of Joe","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-10-6","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487598,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487598","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Baking Bad","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-10-20","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487599,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487599","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Brian the Closer","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-11-10","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487600,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487600","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Turkey Guys","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-11-17","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487601,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487601","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"The 2000-Year-Old Virgin","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2014-12-8","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487602,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487602","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Stewie, Chris & Brian's Excellent Adventure","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2015-1-5","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487603,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487603","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Our Idiot Brian","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2015-1-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487604,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487604","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"This Little Piggy","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2015-1-26","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487605,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487605","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Quagmire's Mom","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2015-2-9","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487606,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487606","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Encyclopedia Griffin","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2015-2-16","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487607,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487607","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Stewie is Enceinte","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2015-3-9","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487608,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487608","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"Dr. C and the Women","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2015-3-16","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":126512,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a9/87/126512_5u6U6.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 12)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126512"}]}
