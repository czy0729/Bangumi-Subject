Bumbling Peter and long-suffering Lois have three kids. Stewie (a brilliant but sadistic baby bent on killing his mother and taking over the world), Meg (the oldest, and is the most unpopular girl in town) and Chris (the middle kid, he's not very bright but has a passion for movies). The final member of the family is Brian - a talking dog and much more than a pet, he keeps Stewie in check whilst sipping Martinis and sorting through his own life issues.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>恶搞之家 第十季</li><li><span>话数: </span>23</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2011年9月26日</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>FOX</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2012年5月21日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":5,"on_hold":1,"dropped":2},"eps":[{"id":487552,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487552","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Lottery Fever","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-9-26","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487553,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487553","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Seahorse Seashell Party","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-10-3","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487554,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487554","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-10-31","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487555,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487555","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Stewie Goes for a Drive","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-11-7","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487556,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487556","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Back to the Pilot","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-11-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487557,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487557","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Thanksgiving","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-11-21","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487558,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487558","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Amish Guy","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-11-28","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487559,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487559","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Cool Hand Peter","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-12-5","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487560,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487560","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Grumpy Old Man","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2011-12-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487561,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487561","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Meg and Quagmire","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-1-9","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487562,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487562","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"The Blind Side","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-1-16","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487563,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487563","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Livin' on a Prayer","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-1-30","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487564,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487564","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"Tom Tucker: The Man and His Dream","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-2-13","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487565,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487565","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"Be Careful What You Fish For","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-2-20","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487566,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487566","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"Burning Down the Bayit","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-3-5","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487567,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487567","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"Killer Queen","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-3-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487568,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487568","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"Forget-Me-Not","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-3-19","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487569,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487569","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"You Can't Do That on Television, Peter","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-4-2","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487570,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487570","type":0,"sort":19,"name":"Mr. & Mrs. Stewie","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-4-30","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487571,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487571","type":0,"sort":20,"name":"Leggo My Meg-O","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-5-7","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487572,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487572","type":0,"sort":21,"name":"Tea Peter","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-5-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487573,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487573","type":0,"sort":22,"name":"Viewer Mail #2","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-5-21","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487574,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487574","type":0,"sort":23,"name":"Internal Affairs","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2012-5-21","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":126510,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/82/2e/126510_nY6Yc.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 9)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126510"},{"id":50159,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5e/cf/50159_4GO0Y.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 11)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/50159"}]}
