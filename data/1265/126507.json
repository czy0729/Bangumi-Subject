Bumbling Peter and long-suffering Lois have three kids. Stewie (a brilliant but sadistic baby bent on killing his mother and taking over the world), Meg (the oldest, and is the most unpopular girl in town) and Chris (the middle kid, he's not very bright but has a passion for movies). The final member of the family is Brian - a talking dog and much more than a pet, he keeps Stewie in check whilst sipping Martinis and sorting through his own life issues.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>恶搞之家 第六季</li><li><span>话数: </span>12</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2007年9月24日</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>FOX</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2008年5月5日</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":6,"dropped":1},"eps":[{"id":487485,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487485","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Blue Harvest","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-9-24","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487486,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487486","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Movin' Out (Brian's Song)","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-10-1","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487487,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487487","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Believe it or Not, Joe's Walking on Air","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-10-8","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487488,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487488","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Stewie Kills Lois","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-11-5","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487489,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487489","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Lois Kills Stewie","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-11-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487490,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487490","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Padre de Familia","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-11-19","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487491,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487491","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Peter's Daughter","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2007-11-26","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487492,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487492","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"McStroke","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2008-1-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487493,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487493","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Back to the Woods","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2008-2-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487494,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487494","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Play it Again, Brian","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2008-3-3","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487495,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487495","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"The Former Life of Brian","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2008-4-28","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":487496,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/487496","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Long John Peter","name_cn":"","duration":"20m","airdate":"2008-5-5","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":126506,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/97/70/126506_n23Xt.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 5)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126506"},{"id":126508,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3c/df/126508_SzYbS.jpg","title":"Family Guy (Season 7)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126508"}]}
