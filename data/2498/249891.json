To control the tank and play the game requires the use of a large controller made specially for Steel Battalion. The controller has two control sticks and around 40 buttons. Only limited quantities were made available. These quickly sold out, making the game a collector's piece. It has since been re-released in limited quantities worldwide, with blue controller buttons distinguishing it from the first edition with green buttons.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>铁骑</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Steel Battalion: Line of Contact</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>てっき</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>鉄騎大戦</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Steel Battalion</li><li><span>平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2002年9月12日</li><li><span>售价: </span>19800円</li>","collection":{"wish":2},"tags":[{"name":"XBOX","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1},{"name":"Capcom","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":58000,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/bc/fb/58000_T3Sl5.jpg","title":"Steel Battalion - Heavy Armor","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/58000"}]}
