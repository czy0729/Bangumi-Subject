It is the third game in the Hexen/Heretic series, and the last in the Serpent Riders trilogy. It was later made available on Steam on August 3, 2007. Using a modified Quake engine, it features single-player and multiplayer game modes, as well as four character classes to choose from, each with different abilities. These include the \"offensive\" Paladin, the \"defensive\" Crusader, the spell-casting Necromancer, and the stealthy Assassin.\r\n\r\nImprovements from Hexen: Beyond Heretic and Quake include destructible environments, mounted weapons, and unique level up abilities. Like its predecessor, Hexen II also uses a hub system. These hubs are a number of interconnected levels; changes made in one level have effects in another. Furthermore, the Tome of Power artifact makes a return from Heretic.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32572\">Raven Software</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/23616\">id Software</a>、<a href=\"/person/17518\">Activision</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Hexen 2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>毁灭巫师2</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Modified Quake engine</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1997年9月11日</li>","staff":[{"id":32572,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/de/f0/32572_prsn_EByEB.jpg","name":"乌鸦软件","desc":"开发"},{"id":23616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/8a/8a/23616_prsn_nA7HE.jpg","name":"id Software","desc":"发行"},{"id":17518,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/cb/6c/17518_prsn_bBbhR.jpg","name":"动视","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":333671,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/2f/c3/333671_lkGfD.jpg","title":"Hexen: Beyond Heretic","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/333671"}]}
