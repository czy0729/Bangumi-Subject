These Planes are realities representing the elemental forces of Air, Fire, Water, Earth, Life, and Death, and it is at the one point where every one of these Planes intersect with each other that Telara exists. Each Plane is governed by a Dragon-deity, which is the personification of that elemental force. Through the actions of the Dragon of Extinction, Regulos, the various Dragons have united in an alliance known as the Blood Storm, for the purpose of invading Telara and gaining use of the intersection of all of their realms. In the past, the Blood Storm was defeated by the inhabitants of Telara with the help of the Vigil, the most powerful of the native gods of Telara.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>时空裂痕</li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/10703\">Inon Zur</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Rift: Planes of Telara</li><li><span>平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>MMORPG</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Gamebryo</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2011-3-1</li><li><span>制作商: </span>Trion Worlds</li><li><span>发行公司: </span>Trion Worlds</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.riftgame.com/</li>","collection":{"collect":5,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"MMORPG","count":2},{"name":"2011","count":1},{"name":"STEAM","count":1},{"name":"网络游戏","count":1},{"name":"网游","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":10703,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/76/0c/10703_prsn_09wmm.jpg","name":"Inon Zur","desc":"音乐"}]}
