The first of the autobiographical strips chronicled Hanuka discovering that he and his wife and their young son need to find a new place to live, immediately and in a “crazy” Tel Aviv real estate market, because the apartment they’ve been renting has been sold. As an artist, husband, father or a regular Israeli citizen, Asaf Hanuka chronicles everyday life in his country, with humor that is offbeat and sometimes surreal. Shot for shot, Hanuka's home is depicted as a vibrant metropolis and provides a brilliant depiction of modern Tel Aviv. Archaia's edition of The Realist translates and collects both volumes of the work previously titled KO À Tel Aviv into a single book for the first time.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>现实主义者</li><li><span>册数: </span>1</li><li><span>作者: </span>Asaf Hanuka</li><li><span>出版社: </span>Archaia</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2015-04-28</li><li><span>页数: </span>192</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>9781608866885</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>www.asafhanuka.com/the-realist</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"漫画","count":1}]}
