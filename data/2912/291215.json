Wreckfest is described as the spiritual successor to the FlatOut series and a cross between FlatOut, Destruction Derby and cult 1989 PC racer Street Rod. A notable feature of the game engine is the use of soft-body damage modelling, which enables location-based damage that affects the driving dynamics of vehicles in a realistic fashion.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>撞车嘉年华</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/36551\">THQ Nordic</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RAC</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2018年6月14日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Bugbear Entertainment</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"PS5","count":1},{"name":"RAC","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":36551,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/4b/30/36551_prsn_bAD0H.jpg","name":"THQ Nordic","desc":"发行"}]}
