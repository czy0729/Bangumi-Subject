When the three of them are transported to the Cyber Dimension, Evox, Cybervillain Blaze, and Cybervillain Roxy gain its de facto ruler Scrozzle as an ally as he helps them in their plan to return Evox to Earth.","info":"<li><span>集数: </span>22</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li>","tags":[{"name":"SABAN","count":1},{"name":"2019","count":1},{"name":"TV","count":1},{"name":"特摄","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":904966,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/904966","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Beasts Unleashed","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2019-03-02","comment":0,"desc":"Scientists tap into the Morphin Grid, providing the city of Coral Harbor with an unlimited source of clean energy called Morph-X.
