This woman is known as Offred, a handmaid to Commander Fred Waterford. Offred goes out grocery shopping with her companion Ofglen. On the way home, they pass by a wall of men who have been hanged due to committing crimes (such as being gay, working in an abortion clinic, and being Catholic). In a flashback, various women are indoctrinated into their handmaid roles by Aunt Lydia, who tells them about declining birth rates and that they are \"special\", serving a Biblical purpose. \"Offred\" enters the room and notices Moira, a woman she knew from college. One of the women in the class, Janine, talks back to Lydia and is shocked with a cattle prod. Later, Janine is revealed to have been punished by having one of her eyes removed. In the present, Commander Waterford tries to impregnate Offred as she lays in the lap of his wife, Serena Joy. The next day, all the handmaids gather in an open field where Lydia announces a man has raped a pregnant handmaid. For punishment, the handmaids are allowed to brutally beat the man. Offred learns from Janine that Moira is dead. On the way home, Ofglen tells Offred that she had a wife and son, and warns her there may be an Eye (secret spies) in her house. Through voiceover, Offred reveals her true name – June, and that she intends to survive to find her daughter.","status":"Air"},{"id":714572,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/714572","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Birth Day","name_cn":"","duration":"00:46:54","airdate":"2017-04-26","comment":0,"desc":"Offred and Ofglen go shopping and they reveal more personal information about themselves to each other. Ofglen tells Offred she's part of a resistance against the government and asks her to join, but Offred declines. Nick, Commander Waterford's driver, tells Offred that the Commander wants to see her alone later that night, which is forbidden. Nick also warns her not to trust Ofglen. Offred and other handmaids go a home to witness the birth of Ofwarren's (previously Janine) child. In flashbacks, June remembers her own daughter's birth. During this time, healthy births were rare and a woman tries to steal June's daughter but is arrested. Offred goes to the Commander's office unsure of what's going to happen, but he just wants to play a game: Scrabble. She later goes back to her room and laughs with relief. The next day, Offred prepares to tell Ofglen what happened that night, but when she meets her outside, it's a different woman, who introduces herself as Ofglen.","status":"Air"},{"id":714573,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/714573","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Late","name_cn":"","duration":"00:53:10","airdate":"2017-04-26","comment":0,"desc":"In flashbacks, the rise of Gilead is detailed.

Ofwarren tells Offred that her Commander is in love with her and that she has a \"real\" name for the child, \"Charlotte\". Offred fears Ofwarren is delusional and comments on her behavior to Serena. Nick drives Offred home and there is a black van waiting. Offred is interrogated by an Eye and Aunt Lydia about her knowledge of Ofglen. Offred eventually reveals she knew Ofglen was gay and is beat by Lydia with a cattle prod. Serena intervenes yelling at them to stop because Offred is pregnant. Nick goes to see Offred in her room to check up on her and they share an intimate moment. Offred later reveals to Serena that she's not pregnant, causing Serena to drag her to her room and order her not to come out. In a flashback, June and Moira attend a protest which turns ugly, leaving several protestors shot by police and explosions set off. In the present, Ofglen and the woman she's in a relationship with are charged with \"gender treachery\", with Ofglen receiving a lesser sentence because she can still bear children. The woman is executed by hanging as Ofglen watches, horrified. Later, Ofglen (now referred to by her \"old\" name, Emily) wakes up in a clinic having undergone female genital mutilation surgery as explained by Aunt Lydia.","status":"Air"},{"id":714574,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/714574","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Nolite Te Bastardes Carborundorum","name_cn":"","duration":"00:52:51","airdate":"2017-05-03","comment":0,"desc":"Offred, who is banished to her room, goes into the closet where she finds the Latin phrase Nolite Te Bastardes Carborundorum scratched into the wall.

While examining Offred, the physician remarks that the Commander is sterile, because \"most of those guys are\". In flashbacks, Aunt Lydia teaches the handmaids (including June and Moira) about the \"Ceremony\": when the Commander has sex with a handmaid. Later, June lures Aunt Elizabeth into the bathroom saying a toilet has overflowed, and Moira threatens the Aunt with a shiv. June and Moira take her to the basement where Moira takes the Aunt's outfit and they tie her up. June and Moira begin their escape, hoping to leave via train to Boston, which has safehouses. When Moira is asking one of the guards for directions, June is approached by another guard who is suspicious of her being alone. Moira is able to get on the train, leaving June behind, though June gives her a smile letting her know it's okay. June is later punished by having her feet whipped. In the present, Commander Waterford has an unsuccessful Ceremony night with Offred. Later that night, the Commander and Offred have another game of Scrabble where she asks him about the Latin phrase; he tells her it means \"Don't let the bastards grind you down\". She also inquires about the previous Offred, in which he tells her that she committed suicide because life was unbearable. He makes it known that he doesn't want that to happen again and releases Offred from her solitary confinement.","status":"Air"},{"id":714575,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/714575","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Faithful","name_cn":"","duration":"00:53:22","airdate":"2017-05-10","comment":0,"desc":"Serena suggests to Offred that she have sex with Nick in case Commander Waterford is sterile.

During a Ceremony night with Waterford, he touches Offred's thigh, which she later tells him never to do again. Nick reveals to Offred that he is indeed an Eye. At an open-air market, Offred questions Ofsteven more about \"Mayday\", the resistance group. Ofsteven steals one of the guards' cars and proceeds to drive away; in the process, she deliberately kills a guard by running him over. She is caught and put into a van.

The head of the Mexican delegates is a woman who questions Offred about her experience in Gilead. With great self-control, Offred tells them, \"I have found happiness\". After the meeting, Offred visits the Commander's office for their usual discussions. He asks her to kiss him. She kisses the Commander and then leaves, ferociously brushing her teeth afterwards. The handmaidens are then taken to a party to honor Gilead and show the foreign delegates their success, including presenting the children of Gilead. Offred's friend remarks that the delegates are interested in fertile women as a source of commodity and trade between the two nations. The next day, as the delegates are leaving, Offred tells them the brutal truth about Gilead. She pleads for their help, but the Mexican ambassador claims that she cannot help Offred and explains her own country's dire situation. When Offred is left alone with the ambassador's assistant, he claims her husband is alive and that he can send a message to him. Flashbacks detail Serena and Fred's life before and during the beginnings of the Gilead movement. Serena is revealed to have been a conservative cultural activist during the \"life before\", with a passion and intelligence equal to that of her husband's. She even wrote a book about her beliefs, titled A Woman's Place. However, after the takeover, she is shown to be completely shut out of the new government planning (to Fred's dismay). Rather symbolically, as she prepares to accept her new limited role in the society she helped create, a copy of her book is seen being thrown out in the trash.","status":"Air"},{"id":714577,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/714577","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"The Other Side","name_cn":"","duration":"00:47:18","airdate":"2017-05-24","comment":0,"desc":"The episode chronicles the story of Luke after he is separated from his wife and daughter.

Luke joins them and as they are boarding a boat, they are shot at by Gileadean guards, who kill several members of the group. Luke and one of the members, a mute blonde woman who was being trained as a handmaid, survive and flee. Flashbacks prior to Luke, June and their daughter Hannah being separated are detailed. June and Luke get help from Mr. Whitford, a man who knew June's mother. He drives them safely out of town and drops them off at a secluded cabin in the woods. Luke and June wait as Mr. Whitford gets documentation for them to escape to Canada. They are confronted by a hunter, who tells them Whitford has been caught and hanged. But the man says he can help them get over the border. Three years later, Luke and the mute blonde woman are living safely in \"Little America\", based in Toronto, Ontario.

Serena and Offred make a trip to the house where Offred's daughter Hannah now lives and while Serena refuses to let Offred reunite with her daughter, she assures her that she is doing fine. She also tells Offred that as long as nothing bad happens to her (Serena's) child, nothing bad will happen to Hannah. Offred furiously curses Serena in a hysterical rant, only to have her told to be quiet; it's not good for the baby. Fred participates in the trial against Commander Putnam, in which he is sentenced to having his hand amputated. In the evening, Fred and Offred talk and he asks her about the paternity of the child she is carrying; she informs him that he is the father but his only reply is \"you do that so well\". The package from Jezebel's is revealed to contain letters from women who have lost family members in the Gilead takeover. Later, Aunt Lydia gathers the handmaids to carry out the stoning of someone who has endangered a child. The convict turns out to be Janine.
