It was developed by Neversoft and was published in 2002 by Activision under the Activision O2 brand for the GameCube, PlayStation, Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance. In 2003 it was published for macOS and Microsoft Windows.\r\nPro Skater 4 is a departure from the previous three games' Career mode, in which the player had a set amount of time in order to find and complete goals. 4 instead featured a Career mode more similar to Free-skate mode, in which there was no time limit to explore the level, the goals are usually offered to the player to attempt by characters found in the level. This Career mode would be later seen as the Story modes of Underground series, American Wasteland, Project 8 and Proving Ground.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>托尼·霍克职业滑板4</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17518\">Activision</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>托尼霍克职业滑板4</li><li><span>平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GBA</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2002年10月23日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Neversoft</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":17518,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/cb/6c/17518_prsn_bBbhR.jpg","name":"动视","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":240382,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c6/b3/240382_mKGkT.jpg","title":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/240382"}]}
