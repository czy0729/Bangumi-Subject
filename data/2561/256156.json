It was later ported to multiple home systems, including the PC, Amiga, Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, Sega Genesis, Sega Saturn, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and various PlayStation consoles, mostly in licensed versions developed by Probe Entertainment and Sculptured Software and published by Acclaim Entertainment (currently distributed by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment).\r\nMortal Kombat II was the second game in the Mortal Kombat series, improving the gameplay and expanding the mythos of the original Mortal Kombat, notably introducing more varied finishing moves (including several Fatalities per character and new finishers, such as Babality and Friendship) and several iconic characters, such as Kitana, Mileena, Kung Lao, Noob Saibot, and the series' recurring villain, Shao Kahn. The game's plot continues from the first game, featuring the next Mortal Kombat tournament set in the otherdimensional realm of Outworld, with the Outworld and Earthrealm representatives fighting each other on their way to challenge the evil emperor Shao Kahn.\r\nThe game was an unprecedented commercial success and was acclaimed by most critics, receiving many annual awards and having been featured in various top lists in the years and decades to come. The game caused a major video game controversy due to the series' continuous depiction of graphic violence. Its legacy includes spawning a spin-off game Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks and having the greatest influence on the 2011 reboot game Mortal Kombat, as well as inspiring numerous video game clones.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>真人快打II</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32718\">Midway Games</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32718\">Midway Games</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Mortal Kombat 2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>真人快打2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>MKII</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GG</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GB</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年4月</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"crt":[{"id":69739,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/14/77/69739_crt_IU318.jpg","name":"Mileena","desc":"主角"}],"staff":[{"id":32718,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/14/80/32718_prsn_HD7Yl.jpg","name":"Midway Games","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":280703,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e0/57/280703_6o0Se.jpg","title":"Mortal Kombat","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/280703"},{"id":79528,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c5/33/79528_HFo28.jpg","title":"Mortal Kombat III","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/79528"},{"id":110796,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c0/f0/110796_77HIs.jpg","title":"Mortal Kombat Kollection","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/110796"}]}
