Reynardo, ex-pirate and unintentional hero, suddenly becomes the last line of the defense against the mad Emperor and his countless ravens. Can he come up with a plan that won’t blow up in his face, for a change? \r\n\r\nIn Stories, each choice you make takes Reynardo into a unique narrative. From tongue-in-cheek takes on heroic adventures to dark, Lovecraftian scenes, Stories’ repertoire is as diverse as it is action-packed. But Reynardo’s fateful decisions won’t always come easy: Sometimes retrieving a weapon lost at the beginning of time means sacrificing the life of an old friend. But with so many choices to make, so many potential dire destinies, wouldn't it be great to be able to come back in time, learn from your mistakes and find the one true path?","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>故事：命运之路</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ARPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2016年4月12日</li><li><span>售价: </span>￥48</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.storiesthepathofdestinies.com/</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":8,"on_hold":2},"tags":[{"name":"PS4","count":4},{"name":"ARPG","count":3},{"name":"PC","count":2}]}
