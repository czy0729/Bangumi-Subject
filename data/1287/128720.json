The game features 10 playable characters: five heroes (SpongeBob SquarePants, Jimmy Neutron, Danny Phantom, Invader Zim and Tak) and five villains (Plankton, Professor Calamitous, Technus, Dib and Tlaloc). For the first time in Nicktoons history, these heroes and villains must work together to defeat the evil Globulous Maximus and his Morphoid Minions who pose a destructive threat to the universe. Each playable character must travel to iconic locales, such as Bikini Bottom and Amity Park, and is assigned a unique gadget to activate devastating combo attacks. The world’s only hope of being saved lies in the hands of this extraordinary alliance between good and evil. \r\n","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>海绵宝宝：致命水珠</li><li><span>别名: </span>海绵宝宝历险记：致命水滴</li><li><span>平台: </span>Wii</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NDS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Party</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2008年10月20日</li><li><span>售价: </span>39.99 USD</li><li><span>发行: </span>THQ</li><li><span>开发: </span>Incinerator Games</li>","crt":[{"id":14579,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/f7/2c/14579_crt_z919y.jpg","name":"海绵宝宝","desc":"主角"}]}
