The Penguins must use teamwork in order to complete levels and build useful tools and gadgets to advance in the game. \r\n\r\nPacked with exciting puzzles to solve, the player alternates between the Penguins, performing acrobatic moves, unlocking paths and creating helpful contraptions. The game will also feature stealth-based missions, super silly interactive moments, bonus levels and mini-games. A special DSi camera feature includes King Julien’s sassy and side-splitting critiques of players’ own photo snapshots.
