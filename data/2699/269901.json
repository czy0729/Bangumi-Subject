The player controls a college student looking for his true love. The goal of the game is to win the girls' hearts before the last summer of freedom is over. Every day, when the main character wakes up, the player can plan the schedule for morning, afternoon, and evening. The choices (such as pleasure, sports, study, etc.) determine what events will occur during the day (if any), and also raise the character's skills in the selected category. Different girls in the game (there are ten of them) have different interests, goals, and preferences. If the character's skills in the category that the girl finds most important are high enough, he has a chance to become her boyfriend and the player is rewarded with erotic images of the girl.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>纯爱物语</li><li><span>别名: </span>True Love ~Jun'ai Monogatari~</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>トゥルーラブ 純愛物語</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ADV</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996/6/9</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
