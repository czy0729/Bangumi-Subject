It was powered by an original game engine that bears the game's name, and had been in development for over three years in founder Tim Sweeney's garage before the game was released.\r\nSince the release of Unreal, the franchise has had one sequel and two different series based on the Unreal universe. One official bonus pack, the Epic-released Fusion Map Pack, can be downloaded free of charge. Unreal Mission Pack: Return to Na Pali was released in June 1999, and added 17 new missions to the single player campaign of Unreal. Unreal and Return to Na Pali would later be bundled together as Unreal Gold. Additionally, the games were updated to run on the Unreal Tournament version of the game engine.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>虚幻</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/18823\">Epic Games</a>、<a href=\"/person/32707\">Digital Extremes</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>魔域幻境</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unreal Engine</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1998年5月22日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"FPS","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":18823,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9d/96/18823_prsn_7CIcG.jpg","name":"传奇游戏","desc":"开发"},{"id":32707,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9c/fe/32707_prsn_SqYQH.jpg","name":"Digital Extremes","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":333991,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/75/d0/333991_iJ37Z.jpg","title":"Unreal II: The Awakening","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/333991"},{"id":248784,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c6/26/248784_D40Lf.jpg","title":"Unreal Tournament","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/248784"}]}
