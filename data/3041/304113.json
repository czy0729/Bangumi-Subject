But when the Overlords fled the planet, they left their former soldiers behind. Now, five years after the events of XCOM 2, humans and aliens are working together to forge a civilization of cooperation and coexistence.\r\n\r\nWelcome to City 31, a model of peace in a post-invasion world. However, not all of Earth's inhabitants support interspecies alliance. Chimera Squad, an elite force of human and alien agents, must work together to destroy the underground threats driving the city toward chaos.\r\n\r\nYour agents are unique: each of them equipped with special tactical abilities and driven by a different motivation for joining Chimera Squad. Deploy targeted team members to investigate and combat the dangers that pervade the districts of City 31. Lead Chimera Squad through a new experience that innovates on XCOM's turn-based legacy, utilizing strategy, teamwork, and new breach-and-clear gameplay to complete your mission objectives.\r\n\r\nThe future of City 31 depends on you.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>幽浮：奇美拉战队</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/17520\">Firaxis Games</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/20360\">2K Games</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>XCOM®: Chimera Squad</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>幽浮：奇美拉小队</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Turn-based tactics</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2020年4月24日</li>","collection":{"wish":7,"collect":7,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"SLG","count":2},{"name":"PC","count":2}],"staff":[{"id":17520,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/e5/92/17520_prsn_SyyRp.jpg","name":"Firaxis Games","desc":"开发"},{"id":20360,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/69/ec/20360_prsn_Vw162.jpg","name":"2K Games","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":309801,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b1/a9/309801_3m8a7.jpg","title":"XCOM 2: War of the Chosen","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/309801"},{"id":140897,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/14/04/140897_01oaO.jpg","title":"XCOM 2","type":"主线故事","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/140897"}]}
