{"id":199330,"type":2,"name":"Elena of Avalor","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3b/60/199330_t2Jo4.jpg","summary":"Teenage princess Elena Castillo Flores has saved her magical kingdom of Avalor from an evil sorceress and must now learn to rule as its crown princess. Elena's adventures will lead her to understand that her new role requires thoughtfulness, resilience and compassion, the traits of all truly great leaders. Since she is only 16, she has a Grand Council composed of her grandparents, older cousin Chancellor Esteban and a new friend, Naomi, to give advice along the way. Elena also looks to her younger sister Isabel, her friends, wizard Mateo and Royal Guard lieutenant Gabe, a spirit animal named Zuzo, and a trio of magical flying creatures called Jaquins (a race of winged jaguars) for guidance and support.\r\n\r\n","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>艾莲娜公主</li><li><span>话数: </span>*</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2016-07-22</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>星期五</li><li><span>动画制作: </span><a href=\"/person/18003\">Disney Television Animation</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>阿瓦勒公主埃琳娜</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://lol.disney.com/characters/elena-of-avalor</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>Disney Channel</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":1,"on_hold":1,"dropped":4},"tags":[{"name":"2016","count":1},{"name":"Disney","count":1},{"name":"TV","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":681206,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/681206","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"First Day of Rule","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-07-22","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":681207,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/681207","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Model Sister","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-07-22","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":681208,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/681208","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"All Heated Up","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-07-29","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":681209,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/681209","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Island of Youth","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-08-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":681210,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/681210","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Spellbound","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-08-26","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":681211,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/681211","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Prince Too Charming","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-09-16","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":681212,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/681212","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Finders Leapers","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-09-23","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":681213,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/681213","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Royal Retreat","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-09-30","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":681214,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/681214","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"A Day to Remember","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-10-16","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":681215,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/681215","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"The Scepter of Light","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-11-04","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":681216,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/681216","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Feliz Navidad: A Royal Christmas","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2016-12-**","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":18003,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/d5/21/18003_prsn_boCNq.jpg","name":"Disney Television Animation","desc":"动画制作"}],"relations":[{"id":199331,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/38/ca/199331_y8FuB.jpg","title":"Elena and the Secret of Avalor","type":"角色出演","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/199331"},{"id":118473,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/98/4b/118473_tZgZN.jpg","title":"Sofia the First (Season 1)","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/118473"},{"id":118474,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f1/9d/118474_8ubfy.jpg","title":"Sofia the First (Season 2)","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/118474"},{"id":149647,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/58/af/149647_05G6W.jpg","title":"Sofia the First (Season 3)","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/149647"}]}
