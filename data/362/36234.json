All you need is a gun, it's Rabbit Season!\"). Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck again are arguing over which of them is “in season” (it is really Duck Season, as Daffy says in the beginning), while a befuddled Elmer Fudd tries to figure out which animal is telling the truth. Between using sneaky plays-on-words, and dressing himself in women's clothing (including a Lana Turner-style sweater), Bugs manages to escape unscathed, while Daffy repeatedly has his beak blown off, upside-down, and sideways by Elmer.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>猎兔季节</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>动画制作: </span><a href=\"/person/13957\">Warner Bros.
