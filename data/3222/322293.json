{"id":322293,"type":4,"name":"Thief's Roulette","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ca/33/322293_Dli8r.jpg","summary":"Thief's Roulette is a first person puzzle game with visual novel-style interactions, largely driven by a character-driven story and intensive puzzle-based problem solving gameplay.\r\n\r\nBefore each of Lady Luck's 7 Challenges, the 15 Contestants are randomly assigned to 3 teams. From there, they will enter their respective Challenge Rooms and attempt to complete the task the fastest. The catch, is that both 2nd and 3rd Place teams will have to take part in the Marking Roulette. Members of these 2 teams are randomly Marked for Death. If you are ever Marked twice, you will be Executed. \r\n\r\nFor the 2nd Place team, the Roulette spins once. Only one player in that team will end up with a Mark. For the 3rd Place team, the Roulette spins twice. With two spins, two players will be marked, or one player could be marked twice...\r\n\r\nWhen a team gets 1st Place, one player from that team is randomly selected to receive the Trade Token. The 3rd Place team will have one player randomly selected to receive the Reroll Token.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Token can only be used right after the teams have been scrambled. With this token you may swap places with anyone else on any team. The Reroll Token can only be used right after the Marking Roulette. With it, the thieves may choose to reroll the marking process. Perhaps for a more ideal result.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>窃贼轮盘</li><li><span>平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>第一人称悬疑解谜视觉小说</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>Coming Soon</li><li><span>开发: </span>hiromu656</li><li><span>发行: </span>Top Hat Studios Inc</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://tophat.studio/#home</li>"}
