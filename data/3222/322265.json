It is the second game in the Descent video game series and a sequel to Descent. Unlike standard first-person shooters, the player must control a flying ship that has a six degrees of freedom movement scheme, allowing the player to move in any 3D direction. The original soundtrack features industrial metal contributed by notable musicians such as Type O Negative, Ogre and Mark Walk of Skinny Puppy, and Brian Luzietti. The game received very positive reviews from video game critics. A sequel, Descent 3, was released in 1999.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>天旋地转2</li><li><span>开发: </span>Parallax Software (<a href=\"/person/38368\">Volition</a>)</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/28805\">Interplay Entertainment</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Descent 2</li><li><span>平台: </span>MS-DOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>RISC OS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996年3月13日</li>","staff":[{"id":38368,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/79/73/38368_prsn_16gww.jpg","name":"Volition","desc":"开发"},{"id":28805,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/30/2f/28805_prsn_8oOfF.jpg","name":"Interplay娱乐","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":322264,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9a/fc/322264_CdY38.jpg","title":"Descent","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/322264"},{"id":322268,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ee/c8/322268_Zg9mK.jpg","title":"Descent 3","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/322268"}]}
