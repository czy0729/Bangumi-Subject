The game was initially released on October 20, 2003 for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. It was later ported to the Game Boy Advance by Visual Impact on November 11, 2003 and to the Gizmondo by Exient Entertainment on August 31, 2005 as a launch title. It is the third installment in the SSX series. On April 17, 2018, it was made playable on Xbox One systems via backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nSet on a fictional mountain, the single-player mode follows snowboarders competing in the SSX Championship. Players choose from a variety of characters and take part in various events in different locations, earning points and money by performing tricks, winning races, completing goals and finding collectables. Money can be used to upgrade character attributes, buy new clothes and boards, and unlock music and extras. Multiple players can play against each other in local multiplayer modes, and an online multiplayer mode also allowed players to connect to games and play against each other online on the PlayStation 2 version of the game, but has since been discontinued.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>极限滑雪SSX 3</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GBA</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Gizmondo</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Snowboarding</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003年10月20日</li>","staff":[{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"艺电","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":322206,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/15/ab/322206_NGgGl.jpg","title":"SSX Tricky","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/322206"},{"id":257500,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ab/22/257500_v4CCT.jpg","title":"SSX on Tour","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/257500"}]}
