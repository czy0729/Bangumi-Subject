Retail copies were released in Japan and PAL territories while in North America it was only available exclusively via the Sega Channel cable service. The character has a variety of weapons and moves that the player must master to complete the game. Many gameplay ideas are borrowed from Treasure's earlier Mega Drive release, Gunstar Heroes (1993). However, Alien Soldier puts an emphasis on challenging boss fights with short and easy levels serving as downtime in-between.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>异型战士</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/11185\">トレジャー</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>异形佣兵</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Alien Soldier</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995年2月24日</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"MD","count":3},{"name":"TREASURE","count":3},{"name":"ACT","count":2},{"name":"RNG","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1},{"name":"1995","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":11185,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5d/e2/11185_prsn_s1SW3.jpg","name":"财宝公司","desc":"开发"},{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"发行"}]}
