That night, she introduces him to Sir Malcolm Murray, the father of Mina Murray, who has recently been abducted. The three of them infiltrate a vampire nest in search of Mina, but instead find and kill a vicious vampire, which upon further investigation, appears to have Egyptian hieroglyphics etched beneath its skin, later revealed to be from the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Ethan, overwhelmed by the new world opening up before him, takes his payment and leaves Vanessa and Malcolm's service, but is later seen to be highly tempted to return. While the horrific slaughter of a young mother and her small daughter rocks the city, Malcolm enlists the help of Victor Frankenstein, who brings his famous monster to life during the episode's conclusion.","status":"Air"},{"id":389256,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/389256","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Séance","name_cn":"","duration":"00:54:01","airdate":"2014-05-18","comment":0,"desc":"Sir Malcolm offers his assistance into the \"Ripper\" case, proclaiming that they should be looking for a beast, not a man.

The Ives and Murray families were neighbors and friends, to the point where Vanessa and Mina were closer than sisters and it was accepted as a foregone conclusion that Vanessa would marry Mina's frail brother Peter. As a young girl, Vanessa caught Malcolm and her mother having an affair; although she kept the secret, she says the experience led to her embracing her dark side, culminating in her seducing Mina's fiancé the night before their wedding. The families severed ties after this, the strain of which caused Vanessa's clairvoyance and mediumship to manifest. She was committed to an asylum, an experience which left her mostly catatonic. Vanessa recovered with the assistance of an evil spirit that took Malcolm's form. Some time later, Vanessa encountered Mina, who forgave her for her transgression, but revealed that she had already been kidnapped by the master vampire. This inspired Vanessa to seek out Malcolm and begin their search.","status":"Air"},{"id":389260,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/389260","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"What Death Can Join Together","name_cn":"","duration":"00:50:25","airdate":"2014-06-15","comment":0,"desc":"Malcolm, Ethan and Sembene track the vampires to a quarantined ship and learn that Mina is closer than they thought.
