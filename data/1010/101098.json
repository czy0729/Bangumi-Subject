Collecting parts will make Knack grow larger – reach the maximum size within the time limit to clear the stage. Super Move (Special Power) Collect Sunstones to use two different types of Super Moves! Use the “Thunder Chain”, which allows you to collect all parts of a certain type by tracing over them with a single vertical, horizontal or diagonal line. Or use the “Blast” to collect parts all at once by tapping on them. Use the two super moves wisely based on the situation and collect lots of parts at once!\r\n","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>17 December 2013</li><li><span>售价: </span>Free</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"Android","count":1},{"name":"IOS","count":1},{"name":"PUZ","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":99599,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/cc/97/99599_0Vz2z.jpg","title":"Knack","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/99599"}]}
