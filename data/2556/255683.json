It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) by Nintendo for North America in March 1988, and then in Europe on April 15 of the same year. Presented in an overhead isometric perspective, a single player races a radio-controlled car around a series of tracks. The objective of each track is to qualify for the next race by placing in the top three racers. Players collect items to improve performance, and they must avoid a variety of hazards such as rain puddles and oil slicks. It is an example of a racing game which features vehicular combat, in which racers can use missiles and bombs to temporarily disable opposing vehicles. Originally titled Pro Am Racing, R.C. Pro-Am was also ported to the Sega Genesis in 1992 as Championship Pro-Am, an enhanced remake with enhanced graphics and additional features. R.C. Pro-Am was followed by two sequels: Super R.C. Pro-Am in 1991, and R.C. Pro-Am II in 1992.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>RC遥控赛车</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/15732\">Rare</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/6734\">任天堂</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Championship Pro-Am</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>RC Pro-Am</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>R.C.
