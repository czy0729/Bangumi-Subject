Undaunted, he begins the study anyway and hires Virginia Johnson (Lizzy Caplan), a nightclub singer-turned-secretary, as his assistant. Upon learning that their sole subject, prostitute Betty DiMello (Annaleigh Ashford), is a lesbian, Johnson sets about recruiting additional female and male subjects, including Masters' colleague Dr. Austin Langham (Teddy Sears). She enters into a sexual relationship with Dr. Ethan Haas (Nicholas D'Agosto) but he becomes overly attached and eventually physically abusive. Masters induces his wife Libby (Caitlin Fitzgerald) to undergo painful and invasive infertility treatments, despite, according to Haas, Masters being the infertile one. Masters suggests that he and Johnson defuse possible \"sexual transference\" by having sex with each other as part of the study."},{"id":286854,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/286854","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Race to Space","duration":"00:54:26","airdate":"2013-10-06","comment":0,"desc":"Virginia has trouble telling Masters that she cannot accept his proposal, but Masters informs her that Scully has cancelled the study because he found out they were monitoring couples having sex. Masters believes it was Ethan who told Scully and fires Virginia on the spot for sleeping with him. Masters moves the study to a brothel with the help of Betty, but he and the participating prostitutes are arrested shortly after. Meanwhile, after being rejected by Virginia, Ethan tries to replicate their sexual liaison with other girls, but to no avail. Virginia coaxes some reluctant prostitutes to rejoin the study, and Masters temporarily takes her back to work with him, but refuses to commit beyond the day-to-day."},{"id":286855,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/286855","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Standard Deviation","duration":"00:53:17","airdate":"2013-10-13","comment":1,"desc":"Masters and Johnson continue working at the brothel but Masters grows increasingly frustrated with the conditions. Betty recruits some men for the study but Masters is nonplussed to learn they are homosexual prostitutes. Betty blackmails Masters into reversing her tubal ligation but the procedure fails, leading Betty to commit to deceiving her fiancé. Haas takes the case of a woman carrying quadruplets but Scully reassigns it to Masters. Masters drops the homosexual men from his study on the grounds that they aren't \"deviant\" but \"deviate\", uses information gleaned from one of them to blackmail Scully into allowing the study back into the hospital.
