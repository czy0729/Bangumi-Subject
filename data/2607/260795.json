It is similar in concept to chess, in that it takes place on a board with squares, but, instead of fixed rules when landing on another player's piece, an arcade-style fight takes place to determine the victor. Also unlike chess, each side has different pieces with ranging abilities. These abilities are enhanced when landing on a square of one's own color.\r\nArchon was originally developed for Atari 8-bit family, then ported to the Apple II, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Amiga, IBM PC, Macintosh, PC-88, and NES. It was designed by Paul Reiche III (who also created the graphics for the game) and Jon Freeman, and programmed by Anne Westfall.\r\nA sequel was released in 1984: Archon II: Adept.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>巫术对弈</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>执政者：光明与黑暗</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>アーコン</li><li><span>平台: </span>Atari 8-bit</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Apple II</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>C64</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>IBM PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC-88</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SLG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1983年</li><li><span>开发: </span>Free Fall Associates</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"艺电","desc":"发行"}]}
