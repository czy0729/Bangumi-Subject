A manga based on the game was released in Japan.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>阿拉伯之梦</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/31806\">カルチャーブレーン</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/31806\">カルチャーブレーン</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Arabian Dream Scheherazade</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>The Magic of Scheherazade</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ARPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1987年9月3日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":31806,"image":"","name":"文化大脑","desc":"开发"}]}
