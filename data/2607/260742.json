The player basically acts out the Civil War, choosing to play as either the North or the South. The player may choose to start the game year from 1861 (the year the Civil War erupted) to 1864. Each year has a different array of armies and states that each side starts with.\r\nNorth & South contains a lot of humorous elements. For example, it features parodies of national anthems, which are accessible when the player selects one of the different languages supported by the game: (English, French, Spanish, German or Italian). In addition, the game is filled with numerous comical situations and gags.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>南北战争</li><li><span>别名: </span>North and South</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>ノース&サウス わくわく南北戦争</li><li><span>平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MSX</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>DOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>ZX Spectrum</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>C64</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SLG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1989年9月</li><li><span>开发: </span>Infogrames</li><li><span>发行: </span>Infogrames</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
