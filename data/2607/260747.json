The player uses a trackball to guide an onscreen marble through six obstacle-filled courses within a time limit. Marble Madness was Atari's first game to use the Atari System 1 hardware and to be programmed in the C programming language. It was also one of the first games to use true stereo sound; previous games used either monaural sound or simulated stereo.\r\nCerny drew inspiration from miniature golf, racing games, and artwork by M. C. Escher. He applied a minimalist approach in designing the appearance of the game's courses and enemies.\r\nMarble Madness was commercially successful. The game was ported to numerous platforms and inspired the development of other games. A sequel was developed and planned for release in 1991, but canceled when location testing showed the game could not compete with other titles.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>疯狂弹球</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/39174\">Atari Corporation</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17916\">Atari, Inc</a>、<a href=\"/person/39174\">Atari Corporation</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>マーブルマッドネス</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>疯狂弹珠</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>C64</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>X68000</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Master System</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GG</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GB</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1984年12月15日</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"staff":[{"id":39174,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/38/4e/39174_prsn_89qQW.jpg","name":"雅达利（1984-1996）","desc":"开发"},{"id":17916,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/57/6a/17916_prsn_FZygZ.jpg","name":"雅达利公司","desc":"发行"}]}
