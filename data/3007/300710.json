The cat promptly explained that it was not a cat, but a creature from the Magic World. Once in a thousand or so years, a fighting competition is being held between the best female fighters of the Magic World. The winner becomes the next queen. The referee however should be a human being; and this time, the honor belongs to our friend Tarou!\r\n","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>Valkyrie: The Power Beauties</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC98</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT&ADV</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995-02-28</li><li><span>ブランド: </span>Discovery</li><li><span>シナリオ: </span>斎藤ケイ坊</li><li><span>原画: </span>しかとみよ</li><li><span>音楽: </span>huMI</li>","collection":{"collect":2}}
