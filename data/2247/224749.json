Travel between outer and inner space, and explore a vast, interconnected universe of things without enforced goals, scores, or tasks to complete. Everything is a procedural, AI-driven simulation of the systems of nature, seen from the points of view of everything in the Universe. \r\n\r\nLearn to transform yourself to create worlds within worlds within worlds, or let go any time to allow Everything to take over and produce a never ending documentary about the world you live in.\r\n\r\nNarrated by the inspiring philosophy of Alan Watts, and featuring a rich score from composer Ben Lukas Boysen, Everything will give you a new perspective on life.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>万物</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>模拟，独立</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2017-4-21</li>","collection":{"wish":4,"collect":11,"doing":1,"on_hold":1,"dropped":3},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"其它","count":1},{"name":"玄学","count":1},{"name":"EN","count":1},{"name":"indie","count":1},{"name":"STEAM","count":1},{"name":"AVG","count":1},{"name":"模拟","count":1}]}
