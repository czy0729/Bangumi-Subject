And Fred Patten is largely responsible. He was reading \"manga\" and watching \"anime\" before most of the current generation of fans was born. In fact, it was his active participation in fan clubs and his prolific magazine writing that helped create a market and build American \"anime\" fandom into the vibrant community it is today. \"Watching Anime, Reading Manga\" gathers together a quarter-century of Patten's lucid observations on the business of \"anime,\" fandom, artists, Japanese society and the most influential titles. Illustrated with original fanzine covers and archival photos. Foreword by Carl Macek (\"Robotech\"). Fred Patten lives in Los Angeles. \"Watching Anime, Reading Manga is a worthwhile addition to your library; it makes good bathroom browsing, cover-to-cover reading, and a worthwhile reference for writing or researching anime and manga, not to mention a window into the history of fandom in the United States.\" -- \"SF Site\"","info":"<li><span>出版社: </span>Stone Bridge Press</li><li><span>价格: </span>USD 18.95</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2004-09-01</li><li><span>页数: </span>383</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>9781880656921</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"其它","count":1}]}
