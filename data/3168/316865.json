Like most 15-year-olds, Duncan can see adulthood on the horizon: money, freedom, cars and girls; but the reality is more like: always being broke, driving with one's mom sitting shotgun and babysitting one's sister. He's not exceptional, but he has a wild imagination in which he's never anything less than amazing. Duncan's mom, Annie, a parking enforcement officer who dreams of someday being a detective, lives in perpetual fear that her teenage son is one bad decision away from ruining his life and will do anything to stop him from doing so. Duncan's father, Jack, is a classic-rock-obsessed plumber who's determined to be a better dad than the one he had. Duncan's 12-year-old sister, Kimberly, is awkward, emotional and can hold grudges forever, while waiting patiently for revenge. She's all emotions all the time and nobody's problems are bigger than hers.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>邓肯小镇 第一季</li><li><span>话数: </span>11</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2020年2月16日</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>星期日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.fox.com/duncanville/</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>Fox</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2020年5月17日</li><li><span>导演: </span>Frank Marino, Anne Walker Farrell, Adam Henry, Chuck Sheetz, Jake Hollander, Will Strode</li><li><span>脚本: </span>Amy Poehler, Eddie Quintana, Mike Scully, Julie Thacker-Scully, Anthony Gioe, Rebecca Hoobler, Nick Mandernach, Ava Tramer, Andy Lee, Sara Scully, Henry Gammill, Isaiah Lester, Andrew Lee, John Viener</li><li><span>原画: </span>NE4U: Ji Eun Kim, Chang Jin Park, Mi Na Won</li><li><span>音乐: </span>John Frizzell</li><li><span>制片人: </span>Julie Thacker Scully, Amy Poehler, Dave Becky</li><li><span>动画制作: </span>Bento Box Entertainment, NE4U</li><li><span>制作: </span>Paper Kite Productions, Scullys Productions, 3 Arts Entertainment, Universal Television, Fox Entertainment, 20th Television</li>","collection":{"on_hold":2,"dropped":5,"wish":0,"collect":2,"doing":0},"eps":[{"id":982851,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/982851","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Pilot","duration":"","airdate":"2020-02-16","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":982852,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/982852","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Red Head Redemption","duration":"","airdate":"2020-02-23","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":982853,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/982853","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Undacuva Mutha","duration":"","airdate":"2020-03-01","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":982854,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/982854","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Witch Day","duration":"","airdate":"2020-03-08","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":982855,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/982855","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Fridgy","duration":"","airdate":"2020-03-15","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":982856,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/982856","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Sister, Wife","duration":"","airdate":"2020-03-22","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":982857,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/982857","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Jack's Pipe Dream","duration":"","airdate":"2020-04-19","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":982858,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/982858","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Judge Annie","duration":"","airdate":"2020-04-26","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":982859,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/982859","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Free Range Children","duration":"","airdate":"2020-05-03","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":982860,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/982860","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Wolf Mother","duration":"","airdate":"2020-05-10","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":982861,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/982861","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Classless President","duration":"","airdate":"2020-05-17","comment":0,"desc":""}]}
