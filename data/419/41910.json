It was followed by a CD-ROM-based remake released for the PC Engine video game console in 1992, which was subsequently ported and localized into English for the Mega-CD/Sega CD in 1994. Snatcher was the second video game written and directed by Hideo Kojima, following the original Metal Gear for the MSX2. The game's story centers around an investigator named Gillian Seed, who is assigned to investigate a breed of bioroids known as \"Snatchers\", who are killing humans and taking their place in society. The game is known for its heavy influence from science fiction cult films such as Blade Runner, Akira and The Terminator.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>绑架者</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/41215\">金津ヒロシ</a></li><li><span>导演: </span><a href=\"/person/16274\" rel=\"v:directedBy\">小島秀夫</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>スナッチャー</li><li><span>平台: </span>MSX2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SegaCD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC-8801</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>侦探冒险</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>26－11－1988</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li>","collection":{"wish":4,"collect":6,"doing":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"SegaCD","count":2},{"name":"EN","count":1},{"name":"日本","count":1},{"name":"PS","count":1},{"name":"AVG","count":1},{"name":"Konami","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":747,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/c1/747_prsn_43cah.jpg","name":"科乐美","desc":"开发"},{"id":41215,"image":"","name":"金津ヒロシ","desc":"音乐"},{"id":16274,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/8b/30/16274_prsn_K4Rrk.jpg","name":"小岛秀夫","desc":"导演"}],"relations":[{"id":192113,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b2/65/192113_C0gIQ.jpg","title":"スナッチャー","type":"原声集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/192113"}]}
