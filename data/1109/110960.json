Her best friend, Stephie, set up her account and profile, which led to a horrible date. Andrew and his co-worker/roommate Stu greet her, and Stu starts feeding him pickup lines. Andrew escorts her to the proper department, and they discuss if they have already met. Later, she calls him at his desk, as her office is in the adjacent building visible from him. After each follow the other on various social sites, he asks her out for a drink. At the bar, a familiar tune plays, and he thinks she attended a concert where he admired her from afar and imagined life together with her. She insists it wasn't her and ends the date. Convinced it was her, he enlists the help of two programmers from work, Dinesh and Lora, to take her Wallflower profile and find online evidence of her at the concert that night. Meanwhile, Stephie tells her about her newest man, a jazz musician named Scatman Desmoines, and reminds her to open her heart to have luck finding love. Zelda apologizes to Andrew for overreacting, but overhears Lora and Dinesh tell Andrew about some online pictures proving she was at the club, only in a red dress and only on the different night than he attended. Furious, Zelda calls him a stalker. Stephie and Stu arrive separately. Stu is \"Scatman,\" a persona he adopted to successfully bed Stephie, for which Zelda busts him. Later, Andrew and Zelda are working late. She calls to invite him for a drink, but he declines, saying she should stay away. She finally admits to being at the concert in a silver dress on the first night. She confesses having trouble getting close to people, but is willing to try again.

The song happens to be the theme music from This Week in Baseball, what he calls his \"Big Glory\" music, accompaniment to the finest moments of his life. Stu worries that Andrew might be in deep and cautions him about moving too fast. Andrew then realizes he has a pre-standing date with co-worker Brooke. He is torn but thinks canceling might set Brooke into an emotional tailspin. He also feels compelled to tell Zelda. She admires his honesty but lies about also having a date. Her jealousy forces her to commission Stephie to find out as much she can about Brooke and quickly arrange a date with Mike, a vapid but hunkish co-worker. Andrew suffers through his date with Brooke, while having Stu recon Zelda's date. He reports that they leave a restaurant early, and Andrew ends his own date to drive to Zelda's apartment. A shirtless Mike opens the door, and Andrew assumes the worst and drives off. The next day, he arranges to meet with her. She blurts out that Mike was only at her apartment because he needed something notarized. Andrew tells her nothing happened on his date either. However, he then reveals hearing majestic music in his head whenever he thinks of her. She merely and politely thanks him. Back in her office, she finds a package that Andrew dropped off for her. Inside, he has crafted a personalized bicycle license plate, spelling out her name by combining several other nameplates into one. Zelda has never found her own in her lifetime. She marches into Wallflower, telling him that she loves it and his confession about his \"Big Glory\" music. They each also insist to not wanting to see other people. She leaves, her own \"Big Glory\" playing in her head.","status":"Air"},{"id":423830,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/423830","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"C is for Curiouser and Curiouser","name_cn":"","duration":"00:21:36","airdate":"2014-10-16","comment":0,"desc":"Stephie demonstrates an app for rating ex-boyfriends, determined not to be surprised by her next suitor. Andrew reveals that Wallflower's research has determined that knowing too much about someone before beginning to date is actually harmful to the development of a healthy relationship. Zelda, hearing Stephie's point of view, does some online research about Andrew. Hours later, she finds dashboard camera footage of Andrew being arrested outside an Oakland Raiders game. Although outraged, she gives him a chance to mention it, but he fails to do so. She lashes out at him hiding his arrest. He explains that it was 10 years ago and the cops had it out for him. She still feels hurt and misled. Back at Wallflower, CEO Lydia begins snooping on her staff via their computer webcams. She is appalled to learn they call her \"Big Bird\". Howard explain that Big Bird is a high-ranking member of the Sesame Street hierarchy. She embraces the term as an honorific. Meanwhile, Dinesh and Lora leave Andrew a USB flash drive with Zelda's Wallflower profile and a few other secrets on it. Andrew cannot help but take a peek. Zelda later apologizes for invading his privacy and his trust. He confesses to perusing her profile, but found nothing. She blurts out that she was once married. She quickly explains about Gustav, a fellow law student whose student visa was expiring. She married him so he stay and practice law. She assures Andrew that it was strictly platonic and she divorced Gustav the day he received his citizenship. She and Andrew agree to not keep secrets from one another.

Zelda rescues Andrew, calling in a favor to get him released. She later explains to him that, while growing up, her only role models were her parents, who were anything but a happily married couple. Still, she understands Andrew's belief in marriage and is less cynical now.","status":"Air"},{"id":423831,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/423831","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"D is for Debbie","name_cn":"","duration":"00:21:36","airdate":"2014-10-23","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":423832,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/423832","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"E is for Ectoplasm","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-10-30","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":423833,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/423833","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"F is for Fight, Fight, Fight!","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-11-06","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":423834,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/423834","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"G Is for Geronimo","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-11-13","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":423835,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/423835","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"H Is for Hostile Takeover","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-11-20","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":462194,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/462194","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"I is for Ill Communication","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2014-12-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":462195,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/462195","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"J is for Jan Vaughan","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2015-01-01","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":462196,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/462196","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"K is for Keep Out","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2015-01-08","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":462197,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/462197","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"L is for Likability","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2015-01-15","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
