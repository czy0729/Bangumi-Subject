Conspiracies and political intrigue endanger the lives of Aliena the noblewoman, Jack the outlaw-turned-mason, Philip the monk and their hometown of Kingsbridge. Will faith and love prevail in the face of violent attacks, ruthless kings and greedy bishops? \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack, composed by Tilo Alpermann, reflects these themes: darkness and violence, longing and loss, faith and passion. Tilo Alpermann’s composition wonderfully orchestrated by the FilmHarmonic Orchestra in Prague is a piece of art retelling the story of 'The Pillars of the Earth' without words and visuals. A wonderful achievement.","info":"<li><span>作曲: </span>Tilo Alpermann、Lukas Deuschel</li><li><span>编曲: </span>Lukas Deuschel</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>2017-09-07</li><li><span>版本特性: </span>digital</li><li><span>价格: </span>$5.99 (Amazon)</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>63m</li><li><span>厂牌: </span>Lübbe Audio</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 The Pillars of the Earth - Main Theme","href":"/ep/794414"},{"title":"2 The Lark in the Hunter's Net","href":"/ep/794415"},{"title":"3 Philip of Gwynedd","href":"/ep/794416"},{"title":"4 Bishop Waleran","href":"/ep/794417"},{"title":"5 Philip of Gwynedd (Resonemus Hoc Natali)","href":"/ep/794418"},{"title":"6 Kingsbridge Cathedral","href":"/ep/794419"},{"title":"7 A cold Winter's Tale","href":"/ep/794420"},{"title":"8 The Choir of Kingsbridge (Veri Floris sub Figura)","href":"/ep/794421"},{"title":"9 They say the Devil has come to Kingsbridge","href":"/ep/794422"},{"title":"10 Milius and Cuthbert","href":"/ep/794423"},{"title":"11 Subprior Remigius","href":"/ep/794424"},{"title":"12 A Boy called Jack","href":"/ep/794425"},{"title":"13 The Roads of Shiring","href":"/ep/794426"},{"title":"14 God thunders wondrously with his Voice","href":"/ep/794427"},{"title":"15 King Stephen and Empress Maude","href":"/ep/794428"},{"title":"16 Meeting the Princess","href":"/ep/794429"},{"title":"17 Richard's Torment","href":"/ep/794430"},{"title":"18 William Hamleigh close on our heels","href":"/ep/794431"},{"title":"19 The Song of Winchester","href":"/ep/794432"},{"title":"20 Father, what have they done to you","href":"/ep/794433"},{"title":"21 Lady Aliena of Shiring","href":"/ep/794434"},{"title":"22 Tom Builder's family","href":"/ep/794435"},{"title":"23 Kingsbridge Cathedral shall be rebuilt","href":"/ep/794436"},{"title":"24 A Man called Jack","href":"/ep/794437"},{"title":"25 He loves You","href":"/ep/794438"},{"title":"26 The Market","href":"/ep/794439"},{"title":"27 Memories of the Jongleur","href":"/ep/794440"},{"title":"28 Hell","href":"/ep/794441"},{"title":"29 He that committeth Sin (Choir)","href":"/ep/794442"},{"title":"30 Bishop Waleran's Wrath","href":"/ep/794443"},{"title":"31 The Roads of Shiring Reprise","href":"/ep/794444"},{"title":"32 Where can we go from here?","href":"/ep/794445"},{"title":"33 The Way of St. James","href":"/ep/794446"},{"title":"34 Foreign Miracles","href":"/ep/794447"},{"title":"35 The Song of Toledo","href":"/ep/794448"},{"title":"36 The Choir of St. Denis","href":"/ep/794449"},{"title":"37 We came to see you, Jack - Love Theme","href":"/ep/794450"},{"title":"38 The Trial","href":"/ep/794451"},{"title":"39 Taking back Earlscastle","href":"/ep/794452"},{"title":"40 The Monk, the Lady and the Bastard","href":"/ep/794453"},{"title":"41 Rest now, Tom","href":"/ep/794454"},{"title":"42 Philip of Gwynedd (12th century version)","href":"/ep/794455"},{"title":"43 The Lark in the Hunter's Net (Ellen's version)","href":"/ep/794456"}]}]}
