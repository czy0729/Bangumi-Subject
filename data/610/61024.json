The game features the likeness, voice acting and motion capture work of martial arts actor Jet Li, and features martial arts choreography by Corey Yuen.\r\n\r\nRise to Honor features a cinematic presentation designed to mimic an action film, with no loading screens and sections of the game split up into \"scenes\". A DVD-like chapter selection menu allows the player to go back to any past scenes once they have been cleared previously.\r\n\r\nPlayed from a third-person perspective, the majority of the game is a beat 'em up, with the player using the right analog stick to direct blows at enemies. The game also features a number of levels where the player uses firearms with unlimited ammunition. During levels, the player constantly builds up a store of adrenaline, which the player can unleash to perform powerful hand-to-hand combat strikes. An alternative is, when using firearms, the player initiates a temporary bullet time mode similar to the video game Max Payne. During the firearm scenes, the player can hide behind various objects such as garbage cans or walls.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>李连杰-义气 荣誉之战</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1018\">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Jet Li: Rise to Honour</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2004年2月17日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Foster City Studio</li>","collection":{"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ps2","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":1018,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/37/28/1018_prsn_Yvv5n.jpg","name":"索尼互动娱乐","desc":"发行"}]}
