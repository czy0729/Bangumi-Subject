A 13-year-old girl has vanished without a trace. Against all their instincts, the tight-knit residents must ask the outside world for help.\r\n　More than 40 years later, the dramatic events surrounding the girl’s disappearance and the hunt for her killer resurface when a high-flying TV journalist makes a documentary about the case. But what she finds will shatter the past – and the lives of everyone involved.\r\n　Juliet Stevenson, Lee Ingleby and Greg Wise star in Place of Execution, a taut psychological thriller from Coastal Productions, makers of Wire in the Blood. Adapted by acclaimed scriptwriter Patrick Harbinson from the best-selling novel by Val McDermid, the three-part drama is set in the present day with flashbacks to the 1960s. It co-stars Tony Maudsley, Philip Jackson, Emma Cunniffe and Sheila Reid.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>道德的刑场</li><li><span>集数: </span>3</li><li><span>开始: </span>2008-09-22</li><li><span>结束: </span>2008-10-06</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>50分钟</li><li><span>电视台: </span>ITV</li><li><span>首播国家: </span>英国</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt1239129</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"ITV","count":2},{"name":"Patrick_Harbinson","count":1},{"name":"Daniel_Percival","count":1},{"name":"小说衍生","count":1},{"name":"悬疑","count":1},{"name":"英剧","count":1},{"name":"伦理","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":231441,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/231441","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":231442,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/231442","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":231443,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/231443","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
