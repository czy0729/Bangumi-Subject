Meanwhile, Montoya and Allen ask a dock worker if he witnessed Gordon shoot Cobblepot. Gordon arrives at the crime scene as he and Harvey head off to get some details from Robert Hastings on who he may have been worried about. During the autopsy on Amanda, Gordon and Bullock learn that someone is using Milkie's M.O. of leaving a penny under the victim's scalp to target their victims. Because this part of Milkie's M.O. was never officially released, Bullock is worried that the new Goat killer is actually not a copycat after all. Alfred is concerned that Bruce, as one of the firstborn of Gotham's elite, may be in danger and suggests leaving town to avoid becoming a target, to which Bruce refuses. Gordon and Bullock visit a paraplegic Dix at a medical facility to ask him about Milkie and the pennies that are part of the M.O. Dix states that Milkie might've had an unknown accomplice in the murders. Later that night, the Goat targets Ember Copley before she can meet her parents at the marina.
