He agrees to give her $200,000, but only if she takes a 6-month job in the office of her brother, Senator Luke Healy. Meanwhile, a large meteor is recovered in Russia and sent to the United States aboard a commercial ship; a large colony of ant-like aliens nesting inside escape and infect the crew. The chief engineer's wife becomes suspicious and alerts Laurel, who learns that the shipment was authorized by Luke. A congressional feud over the budget forces a government shutdown before the meteor is properly secured and the aliens spread throughout the city to infect others. With the help of rival staffer Gareth Ritter, Laurel arranges a meeting between Luke and Senator Red Wheatus to end the shutdown. The two forge a compromise, but Red is infected later that evening and reneges on the deal. He instead persuades another senator to defect and strip the party of its congressional majority. While investigating the lab where the meteor was taken, Laurel finds the lead scientist unconscious. Before he can be treated, the aliens in his head trigger his brain to swell and explode, killing him. Returning to Luke, Laurel helps him move into his new offices and suspects his secretary has also been infected.","status":"Air"},{"id":643367,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/643367","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Playing Politics: Living Life in the Shadow of the Budget Showdown – A Critique","name_cn":"","duration":"00:42:40","airdate":"2016-06-20","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":643368,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/643368","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Goring Oxes: How You Can Survive the War on Government Through Five Easy Steps","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:58","airdate":"2016-06-27","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":643369,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/643369","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Wake Up Grassroots: The Nine Virtues of Participatory Democracy, and How We Can","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:40","airdate":"2016-07-11","comment":0,"desc":"Wake Up Grassroots: The Nine Virtues of Participatory Democracy, and How We Can Keep America Great by Encouraging an Informed Electorate","status":"Air"},{"id":643370,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/643370","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Back to Work: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at Congress and How It Gets Things Done (","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:56","airdate":"2016-07-24","comment":0,"desc":"Back to Work: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at Congress and How It Gets Things Done (and Often Doesn't)","status":"Air"},{"id":643371,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/643371","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Notes Toward a Post-Reagan Theory of Party Alliance, Tribalist, and Loyalty: Pas","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:56","airdate":"2016-07-31","comment":1,"desc":"Notes Toward a Post-Reagan Theory of Party Alliance, Tribalist, and Loyalty: Past as Prologue","status":"Air"},{"id":643372,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/643372","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"The Power of Euphemism: How Torture Became a Matter of Debate in American Politi","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:36","airdate":"2016-08-07","comment":0,"desc":"The Power of Euphemism: How Torture Became a Matter of Debate in American Politics","status":"Air"},{"id":643373,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/643373","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"The Path to War Part One: The Gathering Political Storm","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:00","airdate":"2016-08-14","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":643374,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/643374","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Taking on Water: How Leaks in D.C.
