Having recently suffered the loss of her mother, Libretto has never felt more hopeless. But in the midst of her life’s biggest tragedy, an exciting opportunity makes itself known – as she receives an invitation to watch her closest friend perform at the grand re-opening of the symphony hall in town.\r\n\r\nSoon after arriving at the hall, Libretto feels death is in the air around her…and realizes that this isn’t just any performance – but perhaps the last song that humanity might ever hear...\r\n\r\nThe Ghost of You is a 510,000+ word epic about love, loss, and survival. You make the choices that shape Libretto’s character; and you shape just what kind of an ending you get. With two romance routes and ten possible endings, will you end up with the girl you love, or will you end up alone? Will you fight the evil going on in this place, or will you join it? And most importantly – will you survive the madness of the symphony hall?\r\n\r\nAre you prepared for what’s to come?","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>文字/恐怖/百合</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2018-12-22</li><li><span>售价: </span>$5.99</li><li><span>开发: </span>Noodletub Games</li><li><span>发行: </span>Noodletub Games</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1,"doing":1,"on_hold":2},"tags":[{"name":"百合","count":2}]}
