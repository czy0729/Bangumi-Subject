These 9 years of terrible bloodshed are known to us as the Gallic Wars, which climaxed at Alesia. The victory there resulted in the expansion of the Roman Republic over the whole of Gaul and paved the way for Caesar to be sole ruler of the Roman Empire.\r\nA Lot of Gaul \t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe time period chosen (100-50BC) is principally focused on Caesar's war in Gaul but also includes the major slave rebellion led by Spartacus and the Mithridatic Wars.\r\nYou can be Caesar, a confident general who is prepared to gamble when the stakes are high, or Vercingetorix, the great Gallic commander able to fuse the different Gallic tribes into one nation in their fight against Rome.\r\n\r\nAn enhanced computer A.I. plays an aggressive strategy that requires you to use the best formations and tactics history has to offer in order to win the battle. You may also face off against an opponent in a balanced hypothetical match from the \"table top series\" of battles or join in a multi-player PBEM battle with hundreds of units.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/21895\">HPS Simulations</a></li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Strategy</li><li><span>售价: </span>$49.95</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.hpssims.com/Pages/Products/Ancient/Gallic/gallic.html</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":21895,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9f/0d/21895_prsn_78wII.jpg","name":"HPS Simulations","desc":"开发"}]}
