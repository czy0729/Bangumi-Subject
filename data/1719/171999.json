As German panzers rolled across Poland, a new word was spoken to describe combined armor and air operations: Blitzkrieg.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Following the conquest of Poland, Germany would then turn its attention to Scandinavia and then to France and the Low Countries in the first few years of what would become the Second World War.
