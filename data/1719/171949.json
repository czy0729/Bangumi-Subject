For a little over three years, Korea became the center of world attention.  The so-called \"Police Action\" was all out war for those who served there. Now Squad Battles captures the emotional reality of those three years with 70 scenarios and three campaigns that will give you a real feel and understanding of just what occurred in that Asian land.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth installment of the award-winning tactical level game system by John Tiller. It contains 70 individual scenarios covering the fighting from 1950 until the ceasefire in 1953. Alternately, a campaign game is included, with three different campaigns from which to choose.\r\n","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/21895\">HPS Simulations</a></li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Strategy</li><li><span>售价: </span>$49.95</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.hpssims.com/Pages/Products/SB/Korea/korea.html</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":21895,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9f/0d/21895_prsn_78wII.jpg","name":"HPS Simulations","desc":"开发"}]}
