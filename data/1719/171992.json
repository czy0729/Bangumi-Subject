In the role of the Germans,  you have your chance to try to storm through the Ardennes and reach the coast at Abbeville in two short weeks of fighting. Or,  playing as the Allies, can you stem the tide and prevent the Nazis from overrunning Europe? For it is May of 1940. Germany has overrun Poland and Scandinavia, but now must face the Western Allies. The combined British-French armies have more tanks than the Wehrmacht, and the Maginot Line blocks any German advance westward. Yet within six weeks, the Wehrmacht will fight one of the most decisive campaigns in history and change the course of warfare as a continent shakes.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/21895\">HPS Simulations</a></li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Strategy</li><li><span>售价: </span>$49.95</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.hpssims.com/Pages/Products/PZC/PZC_france40/france40.html</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":21895,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9f/0d/21895_prsn_78wII.jpg","name":"HPS Simulations","desc":"开发"}]}
