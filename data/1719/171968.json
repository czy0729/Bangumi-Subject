Over the course of more than a century the two most powerful nations in the Mediterranean battled for supremacy. The forces involved, and the casualties suffered by both sides, were far greater than in any wars fought before modern times. The outcome of the wars was even greater. For Carthage it meant total destruction. For Rome it meant rising from a regional power to become the dominant military force that would rule Europe and North Africa for hundreds of years to come.\r\nCivilization on the March \t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn this first title in the new Ancient Warfare series of games the primary focus is on the land battles from the second Punic War. The time period chosen (300-200BC) is designed to encompass battles Rome fought not only against Carthage, but against their neighboring Italian states, as well as the subjugation of Celtic and Iberian tribes, and the bloody fights with the Epirotes. Try your hand as a Consul of Rome, Hannibal, King Pyrrhus, or one of the other captains in numerous historical conflicts. You may also face off against an opponent in a balanced hypothetical match from the \"table top series\" of battles included.
