{"id":171975,"type":4,"name":"Defending the Reich","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/68/31/171975_pSdMM.jpg","summary":" Death in the Darkness Over Germany:\r\n \r\nDefending the Reich is an operational level simulation of the epic night struggle between RAF Bomber Command and the Luftwaffe's Nachtjagdflieger night-fighters during the critical period of 1943-1944.\r\n \r\nAs Nazi Germany's fortunes become ever more desperate, and the RAF ever more confident, the struggle is taken to new heights over the darkened cities of Germany and Central Europe. This is the story of that struggle, written large in the piercing searchlights, burning cities and plummeting aircraft.\r\n \r\nThe verses begin as you relentlessly match wits with your opponent, and then continue as brave men venture out into the night. The ending is yours to write, but one thing is certain. To falter, is to lose the tide of the war.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/21895\">HPS Simulations</a></li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Strategy</li><li><span>售价: </span>$49.95</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.hpssims.com/Pages/Products/defreich/DefReich.ASP</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":21895,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9f/0d/21895_prsn_78wII.jpg","name":"HPS Simulations","desc":"开发"}]}
