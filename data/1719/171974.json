Israel's reestablishment in 1948 attracted refugees from the world over but also generated much resentment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n For the next sixty years conflicts would rage with Israel at the center. 1956, '67 & '73 would be years of major conflict and are all covered in this title. Additionally actions in Lebanon ('82) and assorted strikes in '85, '06 & '07 are also covered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe violent Mideast chariot clashes continue thousands of years after the Biblical era, but modern chariots now flash across the sky trailing fire and raining down thunder and lightning on the enemy below.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou will benefit from these enhancements as you command your air force over small segments of the Mideast or over the entire central & eastern Mediterranean air space.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/21895\">HPS Simulations</a></li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Strategy</li><li><span>售价: </span>$49.95</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.hpssims.com/Pages/Products/ModAir/WOME/wome.html</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":21895,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9f/0d/21895_prsn_78wII.jpg","name":"HPS Simulations","desc":"开发"}]}
