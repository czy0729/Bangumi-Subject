While in this forest KSC2-303 begins to forget things and recall strange events he's never experienced. Meanwhile, the mobsters are forced to contend with all of the men they have killed and buried in the forest as they become reanimated as zombies. The leader of the mobsters appears and speaks cryptically of the power of the \"Forest of Resurrection\" and begins to seek out KSC2-303 and the girl as well. Upon encountering the man, KSC2-303 is reminded of his past life and the past conflict with this man and of his destiny in this life: to protect the girl from the man. This is an ages-old conflict that has been recurring in a cycle involving all of their reincarnations.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>千年之战</li><li><span>别名: </span>VERSUS</li><li><span>开始: </span>2000-10-29</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
