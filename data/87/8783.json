Mickey is an expert at the \"long con\", and upon his release, decides to assemble his old team of fellow hustlers to pull off one last con, before he retires for good. His team is diverse in talent, experience and skill; ranging from old hand and mentor, Albert Stroller (the Roper), to the alluring Stacie Monroe (the Banker and Lure), and the jack-of-all-trades Ashley \"3 Socks\" Morgan (the Fixer). Their \"mark\" for this last job is a greedy businessman who they plan to hit with a \"stock market\" con, but as things progress well and go to plan, short con player, Danny Blue, suddenly enters the picture, in his attempt to try and join the team, even by being part of the con itself. But in doing so, he could also jeopardize the score for the others; for unbeknown to the crew, two police detectives have got them, primarily Mickey, under full surveillance, and are eager to imprison Mickey before he retires.

Initially, Frank Gorlay, a crooked casino owner, and the one responsible for putting Albert in hospital, seems untouchable. However, Danny (seeing this as his opportunity to show what he can truly do) helps them to discover a way in; Gorlay has a passion for the movies, the classics, so the gang subsequently attempt to con him into investing in a film (through the 'Angel' scam), with Danny playing the inside as a budding film producer, Stacie as an attractive cast member of the new film, and Mickey and Ash as the investors, with the latter playing the disgruntled member who gets kicked out. Their plan is to make Gorlay invest in an upcoming film, with Ash supposedly taking their money for being \"kicked out\". But as the team's plan works to perfection and towards the \"blowoff\" (getting the mark to believe he won't get his money back if he even tries pursuing the matter), their knowledge of the mark may have overlooked how violent he can really be..."},{"id":50250,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/50250","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Picture Perfect","duration":"","airdate":"2004-03-09","comment":1,"desc":"Albert and Ash inadvertently ripped off an honest but desperate businessman for his last savings, whilst Mickey was in prison, which goes against the first rule of the con - \"Never Con a Honest Man\". In order to make amends, since Mickey now believes that the team is now jinxed thanks to the previous troubles they've had (such as the police surveillance and Mickey's wife asking for a divorce), the gang decide to create a \"fake\" new painting by the artist Piet Mondrian, making out that he had created the style of cubism before Pablo Picasso did. The gang try to sell it to a ruthless art collector and gallery owner, Meredith Gates, a woman with a huge passion for all of Mondrian's work; Danny had found out about her whilst leaving from the same hospital she'd been in. Danny ropes her into the con, posing as a fellow collector who's looking to buy it. However, hurdles lie ahead for the team in the form of a brilliant, but completely untrustworthy artist who likes to set mentally cruel puzzles and games, and an art journalist who Mickey starts to have doubts about as the con progresses; after all, Mickey did believe that they were jinxed..."},{"id":50251,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/50251","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Cops and Robbers","duration":"","airdate":"2004-03-16","comment":0,"desc":"Mickey finds himself being blackmailed by a former cop-turned-bank security manager, Victor Maher (a man whose career at bringing down grifters, was a great success), who threatens to send Danny to prison if Mickey doesn't help him to catch a bank robber. The robber, it seems, has targeted various branches of the bank that Maher works for, all across the country, and is soon expected to hit the London branch. Albert warns Mickey not to comply with the ex-cop, as he fears Mickey is falling into a trap; Albert had been one of the grifters, Victor had caught, and knows better than Mickey does. But when Mickey discovers that the bank robber lost his father, a diamond cutter, to the bank's crooked ways, thanks to a major debt they had, the matter becomes complicated. The robber reveals, that having sought back every penny stolen from him, his last target holds a valuable family heirloom, an uncut diamond, which the bank took and kept for themselves to write off the debt, despite the fact that the gem was worth more than the debt was. Mickey decides to help, but finds himself needing a plan to outsmart his blackmailer, and it's not easy when you don't keep your team in the loop...\r\n\r\nGuest starring: David Calder, Richard Harrington, David Walliams, Phil Smeeton"},{"id":50252,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/50252","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"A Touch of Class","duration":"","airdate":"2004-03-23","comment":1,"desc":"A rich, bitchy, and recently divorced woman (Tamzin Outhwaite) is the target of the team's next con, having ended her marriage over the rows and actions between herself and her ex (such as being locked in a lift when her ex knew she was claustrophobic).
