The album was released on June 22, 1999, by Atlantic Records. The album inlay states that only the first 12 tracks on the album actually appear in the film. The remainder, described as being \"inspired\" by the movie, are mostly other acts performing alternate versions of those songs; however, D.V.D.A.'s \"What Would Brian Boitano Do? Pt. II\" and Michael McDonald's \"Eyes of a Child\" are played in the closing credits. The songs were all written by Trey Parker and arranged by Marc Shaiman, with additional lyrics by Matt Stone.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>南方公园剧场版电影原声</li><li><span>别名: </span>South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut - Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture</li><li><span>版本特性: </span>Soundtrack / Explicit Lyrics</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>1999-06-22</li><li><span>价格: </span>$7.98</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>50:34</li><li><span>录音: </span>Atlantic</li><li><span>碟片数量: </span>1</li><li><span>艺术家: </span>Trey Parker</li><li><span>发行商: </span>Atlantic</li>","collection":{"collect":4},"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Mountain Town","href":"/ep/229756"},{"title":"2 Uncle F**ka","href":"/ep/229757"},{"title":"3 It's Easy MMMkay","href":"/ep/229758"},{"title":"4 Blame Canada","href":"/ep/229759"},{"title":"5 Kyle's Mom's a Bitch","href":"/ep/229760"},{"title":"6 What Would Brian Boitano Do?","href":"/ep/229761"},{"title":"7 Up There","href":"/ep/229762"},{"title":"8 La Resistance","href":"/ep/229763"},{"title":"9 Eyes of a Child","href":"/ep/229764"},{"title":"10 I Can Change","href":"/ep/229765"},{"title":"11 I'm Super","href":"/ep/229766"},{"title":"12 Mountain Town","href":"/ep/229767"},{"title":"13 Good Love","href":"/ep/229768"},{"title":"14 Riches to Rags MMMkay","href":"/ep/229769"},{"title":"15 Shut Yo Face (Uncle F**ka)","href":"/ep/229770"},{"title":"16 Kyle's Mom's A Big Fat B**ch","href":"/ep/229771"},{"title":"17 What Would Brian Boitano Do?
