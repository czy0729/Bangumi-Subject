{"id":60502,"type":3,"name":"Chef Aid: The South Park Album (Television Compilation) [Extreme Version]","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/88/c9/60502_us.jpg","summary":"    Chef Aid: The South Park Album is a 1998 soundtrack/compilation album based on the American animated comedy series South Park. Several well-known artists perform on the record, which was mainly produced by Rick Rubin. Chef Aid contains a number of songs from and inspired by the show, while other songs are largely independent from South Park. The album was released during the show's second season, shortly after the broadcast of the episode called \"Chef Aid\", which features many of the stars and songs that appear on the recording. Soul singer Isaac Hayes appears in character as Chef throughout the album, which mimicks a live concert.\r\n    Chef Aid: The South Park Album was made available with two collectible covers and in three different versions — \"Clean\", \"Explicit\", and \"Extreme\". The Explicit version contains profanities (including \"fuck\") and carries a Parental Advisory sticker, but it is still censored, even for lesser profanities, such as \"goose shit\". The Extreme version was completely uncensored.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>南方公园 声援薛夫演唱会</li><li><span>版本特性: </span>Soundtrack / Explicit Lyrics</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>1998-11-24</li><li><span>价格: </span>$9.98</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>76:42</li><li><span>录音: </span>Sony Music Entertainment Inc.</li><li><span>碟片数量: </span>1</li><li><span>艺术家: </span>Various Artists</li><li><span>发行商: </span>Sony Music Entertainment Inc.</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 South Park Theme","href":"/ep/229776"},{"title":"2 Now Here To Run (vapor Trail)","href":"/ep/229777"},{"title":"3 Chocolate Salty Balls","href":"/ep/229778"},{"title":"4 Brad Logan","href":"/ep/229779"},{"title":"5 Come Sail Away","href":"/ep/229780"},{"title":"6 Kenny's Dead","href":"/ep/229781"},{"title":"7 Simultaneous / Chef","href":"/ep/229782"},{"title":"8 Will They Die For You","href":"/ep/229783"},{"title":"9 Hot Lava","href":"/ep/229784"},{"title":"10 Bubblegoose","href":"/ep/229785"},{"title":"11 No Substitute","href":"/ep/229786"},{"title":"12 Wake Up Wendy","href":"/ep/229787"},{"title":"13 Horny","href":"/ep/229788"},{"title":"14 Huboon Stomp","href":"/ep/229789"},{"title":"15 Love Gravy","href":"/ep/229790"},{"title":"16 Feel Like Makin's Love","href":"/ep/229791"},{"title":"17 The Rainbow","href":"/ep/229792"},{"title":"18 Tonight Is Right For Love","href":"/ep/229793"},{"title":"19 It's A Rockin' World","href":"/ep/229794"},{"title":"20 Mephesto And Kevin","href":"/ep/229795"},{"title":"21 Mentally Dull (remix)","href":"/ep/229796"},{"title":"22 Kyle's Mom Is a Big Fat Bitch","href":"/ep/229797"}]}]}
