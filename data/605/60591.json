It was released on March 18, 2002 in North America; March 21, 2002 in Japan; and May 17, 2002 in PAL regions. Set in an alternate history science fiction world where the British Empire rules Earth and various extrasolar planets, the game tasks the player with exterminating the giant insects that infest the colonies of the planet Tir na Nog. Originally in development for the Sega Dreamcast, the game was moved to the Xbox to take advantage of its improved hardware and controls.\r\nThe gameplay is very different from most third-person shooters, due to a unique dual analog control scheme, which is the main contributor to the steep learning curve of the game. Players travel to various worlds investigating the disappearance of several colonies, with only giant mutated insect creatures left behind. These insects comprise the bulk of the enemies you face along the way.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>枪之女神</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Gunvalkyrie</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>枪战女武神</li><li><span>平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>TPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2002年3月18日</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":2,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"XBOX","count":2}],"staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"开发"}]}
