Are you a lonely person?”\r\n\r\nWhen his mother dies, our protagonist returns home to Wales for the first time in ten years to attend her funeral. Then, on a walk in the countryside, he encounters a mysterious young girl.\r\n\r\nThough her face is expressionless and her words are cold, the man soon forms a friendship with her… of sorts. However, their meetings only leave him with more questions.\r\n\r\nHow did she know his mother, why does she have such a morbid fascination with death, and why does she look so much like his childhood sweetheart?\r\n\r\nBut only one thing is certain: there is much more to Lily than meets the eye.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/18768\">Sekai Project</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>铃兰</li><li><span>平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Casual, Simulation</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>Single-player</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2017年5月6日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$2.99 USD</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://ebihime.itch.io/lily</li><li><span>Steam: </span>http://store.steampowered.com/app/628460/</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"STEAM","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":18768,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a8/50/18768_prsn_A9Cjb.jpg","name":"Sekai Project","desc":"发行"}]}
