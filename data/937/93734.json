Detectives Martin Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rustin \"Rust\" Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) investigate the ritualistic murder of former prostitute Dora Kelly Lange, found with a symbol painted on her back and wearing a \"crown\" of deer antlers. A twig latticework, like a Cajun bird trap, is found with her body. Cohle is convinced that this is not the killer's first victim, but Hart is skeptical. Their investigation brings up the case of Marie Fontenot, a little girl whose disappearance five years earlier was not investigated. Another report is brought up, of a little girl who claimed to be chased through the woods by a \"green-eared spaghetti monster.\" Hart invites Cohle over for dinner, unaware that it is Cohle's deceased daughter's birthday. Cohle reluctantly accepts but, losing a battle with alcoholism, turns up drunk. Hart and Cohle follow up on the Fontenot disappearance with a visit to Marie's uncle Danny. In a dilapidated playhouse, Cohle finds another twig latticework.\r\n\r\nSeventeen years later, Hart and Cohle are interviewed separately about Dora Kelly Lange by Detectives Thomas Papania (Tory Kittles) and Maynard Gilbough (Michael Potts). Hart and Cohle have not spoken in ten years following a falling-out in 2002. Cohle is shown a photograph of another girl whose body has been found posed in similar fashion to Lange. Papania and Gilbough want to know how the killer could have struck again if he was caught in 1995."},{"id":359704,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/359704","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Seeing Things","duration":"00:58:58","airdate":"2014-01-19","comment":6,"desc":"In 1995, Cohle and Hart continue to investigate the murder of Dora Lange, and learn she was attending church prior to her disappearance. Cohle deduces that Hart is cheating on his wife, Maggie (Michelle Monaghan), with Lisa Tragnetti (Alexandra Daddario), creating friction between the two. Cohle also begins experiencing hallucinatory side effects to his drug consumption and objects to Reverend Billy Lee Tuttle's (Jay O. Sanders) decision to create a special unit for anti-Christian crimes to assist in the investigation. The two eventually find Lange's diary and learn the location of the church, which was destroyed in a fire. While searching through the wreckage, they find on a wall a nightmarish painting of a woman with deer antlers.\r\n\r\nSeventeen years later, Cohle and Hart continue being interrogated by Papania and Gilbough. Hart is divorced, and Cohle confides that his daughter died after being run over, leading to the collapse of his marriage and the beginning of his addiction. Upon learning of it, Cohle's superiors transferred him to Narcotics as an informant for four years, and he was later committed to a psychiatric institution for four months after shooting three cartel members. After being released, Cohle requested to be transferred to another precinct as a Homicides detective and ended up in Louisiana, where he was partnered with Hart."},{"id":359705,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/359705","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"The Locked Room","duration":"00:59:19","airdate":"2014-01-26","comment":5,"desc":"In 1995, Hart and Cohle locate the owner of the burnt-down church, preacher Joel Theriot (Shea Whigham), learning that Dora Lange was often seen with a tall man with facial scarring, and begin searching for him while being pressured to turn the case over to the task force. Hart begins to reconnect with Maggie despite her fascination with Cohle, and assaults Lisa's new boyfriend out of jealousy, questioning his own morality. Cohle goes through dead body files in search of cases similar to Lange and learns of Rianne Olivier, a supposed accidental death that shared elements with Lange's murder. They learn through Olivier's grandfather that she attended Light of Way, a religious school owned by Reverend Tuttle, before running off with her boyfriend Reggie Ledoux, a drug dealer, repeated sex offender and former cellmate of Lange's ex-husband, and head out to question Lange about Ledoux. The episode closes off with Hart and Cohle putting out an APB on Ledoux as a tall man covered in scars and wearing only underwear and a gas mask is seen wandering a remote compound wielding a machete, presumed to be Ledoux.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the Papania and Gilbough interviews of Hart and Cohle identify their character flaws, particularly Hart's hypocritical views on morality and Cohle's nihilistic view of the world.

Lange informs them that he showed pictures of Dora to Ledoux and identifies a known associate, Tyrone Weem, as a lead. Hart tracks down Weem at a warehouse rave and forces him to name the East Texas biker gang Ledoux is now cooking meth for, the Iron Crusaders. Cohle, who previously worked with the gang while undercover, takes \"sick leave\" to infiltrate the gang, giving the excuse that he needs to visit his dying father. Meanwhile, Lisa spitefully tells Maggie everything about her affair with Hart, who returns home to find his family gone and his bags packed. He tries to talk to Maggie at her workplace and is confronted by security officers before Cohle arrives to take him away. Cohle hits the Iron Crusaders hangout masquerading as former security for a Mexican cartel breaking away on his own, using high-grade cocaine taken from the police evidence room to back up his claim. He negotiates with his contact Ginger (Joseph Sikora) that if given a commitment to back a deal with the gang's meth producer, Cohle will help Ginger rob a stash house in the projects. Disguised as police, they rob the stash house, shooting one of the residents, and stir up the neighborhood's inhabitants in the process. With the actual police on their way, Cohle drags Ginger away from the house and calls Hart, who collects them from the scene as the police arrive.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, doubts in the investigation start to come forth as Papania and Gilbough question Cohle's sick leave, claiming that there are no hospital records of his father.

DeWall refuses to do a drug deal with Cohle that would allow them to meet up at Ledoux's hideout but, after DeWall leaves, Hart follows him. Hart radios to Cohle his location and the pair meet up near DeWall's truck, hidden away near some brush; Cohle leads the way to the hideout, avoiding hidden explosives laid to kill intruders. The pair descend on the house, weapons drawn; Hart leads Ledoux out to the yard at gunpoint and handcuffs him. Cohle turns his gun on DeWall, who has just stepped out of the meth lab. After Hart searches through more of the property, though, he comes across two imprisoned children; enraged, he strides back out into the yard and kills Ledoux with a shot to the head. DeWall runs but is killed by stepping on one of the hidden explosives. Cohle takes the handcuffs off Ledoux, sprays the yard with bullets from an AK, and the pair later, individually, tell the same story of surviving a firefight (before Hart snuck around and killed Ledoux) to a hearing. One of the children is dead but the girl survives; Hart and Cohle are hailed back at the station and in the press as heroes, with both commended and promoted.\r\n\r\nBy 2002, Hart is back together with his wife and kids, while Cohle has a physician girlfriend. Cohle, a renowned interrogator, is brought in to get a confession out of a robber who murdered two people in a store while he was high on PCP; during the grilling, the man declares that Ledoux wasn't the killer of the missing girls--the real killer was connected to people high up and, he says, he himself heard about the \"Yellow King\" (a phrase related to the case never known to the public). Cohle begins to beat the man but is pulled off him; he returns later with Hart but the man has killed himself after receiving a phone call (purporting to be from his lawyer) from a public pay phone out in the middle of nowhere. Cohle returns to the abandoned religious school, where he finds dozens of stick sculptures, and drawings and black stars on the walls.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Papania and Gilbough tell Hart that they suspect Cohle, who had always been leading him to the next convenient clue or lead in the case, was behind the killings all along; Cohle has been spotted among the crowds of bystanders at the taped-off scene of a recent killing in Lake Charles that seems eerily similar to the Dora Lange case. Cohle walks out of his interview after the detectives accuse him, ridiculing them to get a warrant, while Hart is asked in his interview to explain what exactly happened between him and Cohle in 2002."},{"id":359708,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/359708","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Haunted Houses","duration":"00:58:39","airdate":"2014-02-23","comment":9,"desc":"In 2002, Cohle investigates on his own a series of old missing persons cases, linking the victims to the Tuttle schools. He seeks out Theriot, who has since quit the ministry and become a drunk, to ask about Wellspring, a defunct foundation that financed the rural schools while Theriot was a seminarian at the college Tuttle established. Theriot claims that Wellspring covered up child molestation scandals and implies that he was intimidated into silence after being questioned in 1995. Cohle tries to interview Kelly, Ledoux's surviving victim in 1995 and institutionalized with regressive catatonia, to ask her if a third man was involved with her abduction. She describes a giant man with scars, and begins screaming when Cohle asks about the man's face. Despite being ordered to stop his investigations, Cohle meets with Tuttle, ostensibly seeking the names of former Wellspring employees but actually fishing for reactions from him. Tuttle tells him that once the government enacts a new school voucher program, he is going to reintroduce the Wellspring concept. Tuttle complains to the department, misrepresenting the nature of the meeting. Cohle cites this as proof of Tuttle's culpability, but is suspended from duty anyway. Hart runs into Beth (Lili Simmons), a former underage prostitute he interviewed during the Dora Lange investigation, and starts an affair with her. A suspicious Maggie checks Hart's cell and finds a picture of Beth. She goes to Cohle's apartment and seduces him; Cohle, disgusted and infuriated when Maggie tells him she had sex to get rid of Hart, kicks her out. Maggie tells Hart anyway, who attacks Cohle in the department parking lot. Cohle quits immediately after.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Papania and Gilbough interview Maggie, now remarried. She is scornful of their motives and denies that the divorce from Hart had anything to do with Cohle. Asked to characterize Cohle, she describes him as a good man with integrity. Hart abruptly walks out on his interview when Papania and Gilbrough again suggest that Cohle may have killed Tuttle in 2010 and been responsible for all the other murders. Cohle follows Hart and initiates their first contact since the fight. Cohle asks Hart to buy him a beer, saying they should talk, to which Hart agrees, but after Cohle turns away, arms himself with a revolver."},{"id":359709,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/359709","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"After You've Gone","duration":"00:54:38","airdate":"2014-03-02","comment":3,"desc":"In 2012, Cohle prods a disinclined Hart to assist him in finding the man with the facial scars by reminding Hart that he, in addition to Cohle, owes a moral debt for what actually took place in 1995. He takes Hart to a self storage facility where he convinces him of the existence of a cult that mixes elements of the courir de Mardi Gras, santería and voudon in its rites and shows him evidence he has compiled linking Tuttle and possibly others in the disappearances of dozens of women and children going back to the 1980s. Cohle admits burgling Tuttle's homes to obtain proof of his complicity, including photographs and a videotape of the ritualistic sacrifice of Marie Fontenot years ago. However he denies killing Tuttle, speculating that others believed Tuttle was going to be blackmailed over the videotape and killed him to prevent it. Hart finds a Ledoux relative who confirms that Reggie and DeWall were connected to the man with scars, and locates a former domestic who worked for Tuttle's father Sam when they still lived in Vermilion Parish. She recalls a scarred boy who was one of Sam Tuttle's illegitimate grandchildren from his \"other\" family, named Childress. Hart also discovers that the Vermilion Parish deputy originally handling the Fontenot disappearance was Hart's old friend (and Cohle's antagonist) Steve Geraci, who concealed the fact in 1995 and has since gone on to become a parish sheriff. Feeling out Geraci, Hart concludes that a coverup of Marie Fontenot's abduction was engineered by then-Vermilion Parish Sheriff Ted Childress. Hart and Cohle kidnap Geraci to coerce the details from him. Meanwhile, Gilbough and Papania are lost trying to locate a rural church Cohle mentioned in his interview and ask directions from a man mowing the grass in a parish cemetery. The man, badly scarred on his lower face, mutters to himself as they drive away, \"My family's been here a long, long time.\""},{"id":359710,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/359710","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Form and Void","duration":"00:55:56","airdate":"2014-03-09","comment":5,"desc":""}],"staff":[{"id":38628,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/04/49/38628_prsn_MOomu.jpg","name":"HBO","desc":"制作"},{"id":42374,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/fd/81/42374_prsn_76gBZ.jpg","name":"Matthew McConaughey","desc":"执行制片人"},{"id":42374,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/fd/81/42374_prsn_76gBZ.jpg","name":"Matthew McConaughey","desc":"主演"}],"relations":[{"id":121623,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/45/4b/121623_Le22a.jpg","title":"True Detective Season 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/121623"}],"like":[{"id":23455,"name":"疑犯追踪 第一季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ec/94/63919_7WyYZ.jpg"},{"id":52779,"name":"疑犯追踪 第二季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c5/9a/52779_MV1d7.jpg"},{"id":43261,"name":"新闻编辑室 （第一季）","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5d/c3/43261_p1d36.jpg"},{"id":298127,"name":"风骚律师 第五季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/83/bf/298127_fhDd3.jpg"},{"id":37716,"name":"权力的游戏 第二季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a0/15/37716_UUnlU.jpg"},{"id":7200,"name":"火线 第一季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/23/54/7200_uCTP6.jpg"},{"id":218100,"name":"风骚律师 第四季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/53/68/218100_U7003.jpg"},{"id":63823,"name":"纸牌屋（第一季）","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9a/db/63823_m22AL.jpg"}]}
