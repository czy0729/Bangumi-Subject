After the orders that she has always dreamed of finally arrive, she finds herself in charge of a small destroyer and tasked with discovering the fate of a missing research team investigating an ancient civilization. Mystery swirls all around her as she reunites with old friends, meets emotional trials head-on, and faces the danger with new allies.\r\n\r\nAs the universe she knows falls apart around her, it is up to Natalie’s brilliance and the dedication of the crew of the KSS Nimross to avert a galaxy-shattering event that could spell the end of all space travel. With determination in her heart, Natalie rises to the chance to beat back the danger and perhaps find love in the twinkling lights of the distant stars.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/18768\">Sekai Project</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS X</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ADV 视觉小说</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Ren'Py</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2013年10月31日</li><li><span>售价: </span>免费</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.idhasstudios.com/?page_id=257</li><li><span>开发: </span>IDHAS Studios</li><li><span>人物设定: </span>Nuge</li><li><span>背景: </span>lordless</li><li><span>原画: </span>Jason/tscbr</li><li><span>剧本: </span>Chief Komi</li><li><span>音乐: </span>Felipe Adorno Vassao (Red Rose)、Wiseguy Entertainment (A Candles Light)、Alexander Khaskin (Driving Dream, Science and Technology 2,3,4, Solaris, Strangeness, Trouble in Paradise, Urgent Information, Written In Blood, and several nameless pieces.)、Emmett Cooke (Ned of the Hill)、Lights Out Dancing (Broken Compass; aka the opening song)、Stefan Bode (Nibblepits)</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"on_hold":1},"staff":[{"id":18768,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a8/50/18768_prsn_A9Cjb.jpg","name":"Sekai Project","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":322057,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3f/23/322057_91ze1.jpg","title":"Rising Angels: The Red Rose","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/322057"},{"id":322058,"image":"","title":"Rising Angels: Fates","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/322058"}]}
