Mother says so. Mother says he has to pay with his life. Although, she knows by now Guilleme is no ordinary man. He is tainted. Inhuman. A monster. He cannot be killed by usual means. To seek the best revenge, she must find out all his secrets and destroy him. But will her own dark desires consume her or liberate her?\r\n\r\nNo matter.\r\n\r\nMother will tell her what to do.\r\n\r\nSet in the romantic 18th century France, play as the third person point of view character of Mother — a unique twist to the visual novel decision making medium. Decide the fate of the characters, scold or console, argue or assent... Just don’t be surprised if they start to question your commands.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>CUPID - A free to play Visual Novel</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS X</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ADV 视觉小说</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2015年9月19日</li><li><span>售价: </span>免费</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://fervent.itch.io/cupidvn</li><li><span>开发: </span>Fervent</li><li><span>发行: </span>Afterthought Studios</li><li><span>其他发行日期: </span>2016年3月4日(Steam)</li><li><span>导演: </span>ameliori</li><li><span>剧本: </span>ameliori</li><li><span>人物设定: </span>ameliori</li><li><span>原画: </span>ameliori</li><li><span>背景: </span>Artsvarn、Erik Markus、ameliori</li><li><span>音乐: </span>Circus、Marcus Kevin、Macleod Krichotomy、Autum Elm、yasupochi</li><li><span>程序: </span>Marionette、ameliori</li><li><span>校对: </span>ColaCat、Saltome、The Library Cat</li><li><span>QC: </span>Sasquatchii、The Library Cat</li>"}
