This weapon is used to attack enemies that appear on a lower plane than that of your craft, which are inaccessible to the player's primary weapon. During play, the screen predominantly scrolls vertically, but there is some horizontal leeway as is common in games of this genre.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>Layer Section</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/7482\">Taito</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/7482\">Taito</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>RayForce</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>RAY FORCE</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Gunlock</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Galactic Attack</li><li><span>平台: </span>SS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995/9/14</li><li><span>Publisher: </span>Taito</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"TAITO","count":1},{"name":"SS","count":1},{"name":"日本","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":7482,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/54/d7/7482_prsn_Ad23D.jpg","name":"太东","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":260093,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/41/23/260093_2otEO.jpg","title":"レイストーム","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/260093"}]}
