{"id":314876,"type":4,"name":"Pole Position","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6c/dd/314876_6MOTO.jpg","summary":"Pole Position is an arcade racing video game that was released by Namco in 1982 and licensed to Atari, Inc. for US manufacture and distribution, running on the Namco Pole Position arcade system board. It was the most popular coin-operated arcade game of 1983, and is considered one of the most important titles from the video arcade's golden age. Pole Position was released in two configurations: a standard upright cabinet, and an environmental/cockpit cabinet. Both versions feature a steering wheel and a gear shifter for low and high gears, but the environmental/cockpit cabinet featured both an accelerator and a brake pedal, while the standard upright one only featured an accelerator pedal.\r\n\r\nIn this game, the player controls a Formula One race car, and has to complete a time trial lap within a certain amount of time (between 57 and 120 seconds) to qualify for an F1 race at the Fuji Racetrack. After qualifying, the player races against seven other CPU-controlled cars in a championship race (but if he or she does not qualify, the car will stay on the track until the timer runs out). The player must also avoid going off the road so that he or she will not crash into the billboards.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>杆位</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a>（日本）、<a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/39417\">慶野由利子</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ポールポジション</li><li><span>平台: </span>Intellivision</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>DOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>BBC Micro</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>ZX Spectrum</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>TI-99/4A</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Vectrex</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>VIC-20</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Commodore 64</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 5200</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 400/800</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>竞速</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1982年11月</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":1598,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9c/19/1598_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"南梦宫","desc":"开发"},{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"发行"},{"id":39417,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/85/17/39417_prsn_9kNZ8.jpg","name":"慶野由利子","desc":"音乐"}],"relations":[{"id":315035,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d5/b8/315035_wkSz9.jpg","title":"Pole Position II","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/315035"}]}
