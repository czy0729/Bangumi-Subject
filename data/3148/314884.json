The premise of the game is related loosely to quantum physics in that the player directs a probe with a trackball to encircle atomic \"particles\" for points, without touching various other particles. Once the particles are surrounded by the probe's tail they are destroyed.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1982年12月</li><li><span>开发: </span>General Computer Corporation</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"发行"}]}
