It was licensed to Centuri for manufacture in North America in October 1981 and to Zaccaria in Italy the same year. Cinematronics converted the game to cocktail arcade cabinets in North America.\r\n\r\nThe player flies a ship through forced-scrolling tunnels with sections that move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, to reach a boss at the end. The ship is controlled with an 8-way joystick, and it can fire in four directions via four buttons in a diamond arrangement.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>先锋号</li><li><span>开发: </span>Tose（株式会社<a href=\"/person/11272\">トーセ</a>）</li><li><span>发行: </span>Zaccaria、<a href=\"/person/705\">SNK</a>、<a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a>、<a href=\"/person/39413\">Centuri</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ヴァンガード</li><li><span>平台: </span>Atari 5200</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Scrolling STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1981年</li><li><span>程序: </span>Dave Payne</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":11272,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/19/0e/11272_prsn_Jltqe.jpg","name":"东星软件","desc":"开发"},{"id":705,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a5/82/705_prsn_o7m1w.jpg","name":"SNK","desc":"发行"},{"id":39413,"image":"","name":"Centuri","desc":"发行"},{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"发行"}]}
