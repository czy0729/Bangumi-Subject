But its modern-rock song-score \"Album\" (Christophe Beck's more traditional orchestral score is also available) has no such obstacle, gathering together new recordings that punctuate the film's milieu with often forceful effectiveness. Jet keeps things lively with \"Hey Kids,\" another rollicking dose of snotty retro-pop from the Aussie newcomers, while \"Breathe No More\" by Evanescence (previously only available as a live cut) is essentially a solo showcase for the emotive moodiness of singer Amy Lee's dusky voice, yet one that finds ample resonance with the film's title character. A shadowy remix of Finger Eleven's \"Thousand Mile Wish,\" Taking Back Sunday's new \"Your Own Disaster\" and Strata's \"Never There\" mine a similarly introspective vein, contrasting well with more lively cuts like The Donnas' \"Everything Is Wrong\" and \"5 Years\" by NYC's Twenty-Twos. --Jerry McCulley","info":"<li><span>版本特性: </span>Soundtrack</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>2005-01-11</li><li><span>价格: </span>$8.13</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>97 minutes</li><li><span>碟片数量: </span>1</li><li><span>出版者: </span>Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation</li><li><span>条形码: </span>0601501310720</li><li><span>ASIN: </span>B0006UEVJ0</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"Soundtrack","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Strata - Never There (She Stabs)","href":"/ep/678598"},{"title":"2 Jet - Hey Kids","href":"/ep/678599"},{"title":"3 The Donnas - Everyone Is Wrong","href":"/ep/678600"},{"title":"4 Switchfoot - Sooner or Later","href":"/ep/678601"},{"title":"5 Finger Eleven - Thousand Mile Wish (Elektra mix)","href":"/ep/678602"},{"title":"6 Megan McCauley - Wonder","href":"/ep/678603"},{"title":"7 Taking Back Sunday - Your Own Disaster","href":"/ep/678604"},{"title":"8 Evanescence - Breathe No More","href":"/ep/678605"},{"title":"9 12 Stones - Photograph","href":"/ep/678606"},{"title":"10 Alter Bridge - Save Me","href":"/ep/678607"},{"title":"11 The Dreaming - Beautiful","href":"/ep/678608"},{"title":"12 Submersed - Hollow","href":"/ep/678609"},{"title":"13 Hawthorne Heights - Angels With Even Filthier Souls","href":"/ep/678610"},{"title":"14 The Twenty Twos - 5 Years","href":"/ep/678611"},{"title":"15 Full Blown Rose - In The Light","href":"/ep/678612"}]}],"relations":[{"id":130117,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/28/01/130117_KGgga.jpg","title":"Elektra","type":"三次元","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/130117"}]}
