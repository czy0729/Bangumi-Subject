{"id":198304,"type":6,"name":"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia Season 3","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ab/37/198304_4UMtS.jpg","summary":"The Gang's narcissism spins out of control, as usual. First they decide to do good: Sweet Dee and Mac adopt a baby that was abandoned in a dumpster, Dennis volunteers with environmental rights activists, and everyone in the gang become vigilantes to solve Philadelphia's homeless problem. The gang then hatches several schemes to become famous: Mac, Frank, and Charlie try to be viral video stars by covering the local news while Dennis and Dee seek fame as spoiled, drug-addled club hoppers. Sweet Dee dates a local rapper mistakenly thought to be mentally handicapped by Mac and Dennis, the two of whom start a band, but can't quite pinpoint their genre of music—especially when Charlie comes up with a raunchy, disjointed song about a mysterious creature who violates him in his sleep.\r\n\r\nThe Gang's jealousy and greed come roaring back when they fight over Barbara's inheritance, after she wills the house to Dennis. Dee gets jealous of her high school friend (who lost weight and has a successful career in fashion design) and decides to start her very own sweatshop. The entire gang struggles to compete with a local bar owned by a Korean man who looks like Kim Jong-il, and then decide to sell out by offering Paddy's Pub to a corporate chain. Two members of the gang find themselves on the wrong side of the law due to mistaken identity: Mac is suspected to be a serial killer after becoming distant from the gang and Dennis is mistaken for a registered sex offender who targets children after a real sex offender (who looks like a fatter version of Dennis) is released from prison due to overcrowding. Meanwhile, the gang sells some cocaine found in a pair of abandoned stereo speakers, forcing them to turn to crime and prostitution to earn the money back before some local Mafia members whack them.\r\n\r\nFinally, the gang is forced to save themselves from Charlie's mistakes. First, the McPoyles get revenge on the gang for revealing their false molestation charge (from season one's finale \"Charlie Got Molested\") and inadvertently shooting their brother Doyle (from this season's \"The Gang Gets Invincible\") after he was invited to the Eagles' training camp by taking all of them hostage in their own bar. Finally, Charlie's illiteracy screws over the gang when he accidentally puts the bar up as a prize for a dance marathon, and all the enemies made throughout the course of the series enter the contest so they can take the bar away from the gang. The gang won't let the bar go without a fight—but not before using dirty tricks on each other.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>费城永远阳光灿烂 第三季</li><li><span>集数: </span>15</li><li><span>开始: </span>September 13, 2007</li><li><span>结束: </span>November 15, 2007</li><li><span>类型: </span>剧情 / 喜剧 / 爱情 / 家庭</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>电视网: </span>FX</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>www.fxnetworks.com/sunny/</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0792192</li>","eps":[{"id":678212,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678212","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678213,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678213","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678214,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678214","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678215,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678215","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678216,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678216","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678217,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678217","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678218,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678218","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678219,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678219","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678220,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678220","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678221,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678221","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678222,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678222","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678223,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678223","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678224,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678224","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678225,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678225","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678226,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678226","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
