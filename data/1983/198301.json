{"id":198301,"type":6,"name":"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia Season 2","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/49/3e/198301_Xh0I6.jpg","summary":"The series' second season introduces veteran actor Danny DeVito portraying Dennis and Dee's father Frank, who moves in with a wheelchair-bound Charlie following a car accident and blackmails his way into the group. Anne Archer also has a recurring role as Barbara Reynolds, Dee and Dennis's promiscuous, cold-hearted mother. Meanwhile, Mac has sex with Barbara and spins a web of lies and deception in order to throw the rest of the gang off his tracks.\r\n\r\nThe gang ups their efforts on the scheming front: the gang tries to fight back against a property anomaly that leaves their bar in the path of an Israeli immigrant's new place, Dennis and Dee quit their jobs and hatch a plot to get on welfare so they can live out their dream careers, and Frank—along with Charlie and Mac—exploit the religious when they discover a water stain in the back room that resembles The Virgin Mary. Charlie and Dee fight against cigarette smoking, with hilarious results, while Frank, Mac, and Dennis fight back against their freedoms being encroached by making their bar an \"anything goes\" establishment that first attracts drunk college girls willing to flash their breasts for beads, but goes pearshape when heroin addicts, Vietnamese gamblers, and the incestuous McPoyle siblings get in on the action. At the end of the season, Dennis and Dee find a man on MySpace who claims (and turns out) to be their biological father, while Mac reunites with his convict dad, and Charlie is still trying to find the identity of his missing father.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>费城永远阳光灿烂 第二季</li><li><span>集数: </span>10</li><li><span>开始: </span>June 29, 2006</li><li><span>结束: </span>August 17, 2006</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>电视网: </span>FX</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0786802</li>","eps":[{"id":678192,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678192","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678193,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678193","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678194,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678194","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678195,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678195","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678196,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678196","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678197,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678197","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678198,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678198","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678199,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678199","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678200,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678200","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":678201,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/678201","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
