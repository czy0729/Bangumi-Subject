Rick takes Morty to another dimension, known as Dimension 35-C, which has the perfect conditions for growing \"Mega Trees\", which Rick requires for his research. In order to get past intergalactic customs, Morty hides the Mega Tree seeds in his rectum, but when their cover is blown, Rick and Morty escape while engaging in a shootout with bureaucratic alien insects. Ultimately, the seeds are used to briefly make Morty highly intelligent, causing his parents to believe he is fine with his education.

He and Morty then go into the dreams of Morty's math teacher to persuade him to give Morty an \"A\" grade in class so Morty can be assigned less homework. They go from Morty's math teacher's dreams to the dreams of a strong black female TV character named Mrs. Pancake, to a centaur's dreams, and so on. This results in Rick and Morty eventually encountering Scary Terry (a parody of Freddy Krueger). Scary Terry begins chasing the two of them through multiple dreams, causing Rick to become unhinged. At one point the two come across a dream of a post-apocalyptic city where they decide to hide from Scary Terry until he gets tired. When Scary Terry eventually sleeps, Rick and Morty enter his dreams and quickly persuade him to help the duo complete their mission. Meanwhile, after watching several exaggerated infomercials on dogs, Snuffles builds an advanced mechanical suit with a translator to speak to humans. He assembles a robot dog army and proceeds to take over the human race. Rick finds Morty and gives him pills which will make his kidneys shut down. Morty is later seen lying down on a hospital bed in critical state with Snuffles by his side trying to keep him alive. Snuffles awakens (the aforementioned scenario is revealed to be a dream) and realizes that conquering Earth isn't the answer and that dog-kind must not fall to the fate of humankind with its destruction. Snuffles and Morty have a tearful goodbye as Snuffles leaves for another planet for intelligent dogs where compassion is exercised and \"pet insurance is mandatory.\"\r\nPost-Credit Scene: Back in Scary Terry's class, the old teacher has been replaced by a new, hippie teacher named Mr. Scary Johnson, but then informs that that is what his father is called and prefers to be addressed as \"Mr. Scary Glen\".

Jerry asks Rick to show them his idea of good television and Rick upgrades the cable to show programming from every conceivable dimension. They come across Jerry on TV which they are eager to watch but which Rick argues is unimportant. To quell them, he gives them a pair of goggles that allow them to see through the eyes of alternate reality versions of themselves. While initially satisfying, these realities reveal some uncomfortable truths and unearth certain hostile feelings. Jerry and Beth both become fixated on watching an alternate reality in which they aborted her pregnancy and never married, and they both seem to be much more successful and happy for it: Beth is a successful human heart surgeon, and Jerry is a famous actor (playing roles Tom Hanks had in our reality). Summer, believing that as the result of an unplanned pregnancy she is the cause of her parent's distress and shaky state of marital affairs, threatens to run away. While she is packing her bags, Morty tells her that in an alternate universe, he and Rick destroyed the entire universe and that his mutilated corpse is buried in the ground (referring to the events of \"Rick Potion No. 9\"). He says that \"nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody's gonna die\", so Summer should not worry. Persuaded by this argument, Summer agrees to stay. Ultimately, it turns out that Beth and Jerry's alternates are miserable in their own ways: alternate-Beth is lonely and spends her days drinking wine and caring for a large collection of birds while alternate-Jerry has a mental breakdown and drives a lawnmower down the highway in his underwear until he arrives at alternate-Beth's house. He declares that he hates being an actor, Beth was the best thing that ever happened to him, and not a day has gone by that he didn't wonder what might have been if they had kept the baby and stayed together. Alternate Beth and Jerry tearfully embrace and kiss, causing main-universe Beth and Jerry to similarly embrace and reconcile.\r\nPost-Credit Scene: As the family watches a channel of an alternate reality where hamsters live in human rectums, they begin asking questions to Rick, who is trying to watch the TV until he becomes irritated and takes them to the alternate reality itself resulting in a family vacation to that reality."},{"id":359059,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/359059","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Something Ricked This Way Comes","duration":"00:22:15","airdate":"2014-03-24","comment":9,"desc":"导演/ John Rice\r\n编剧 /Mike McMahan\r\nSummer reports to her first job in an antique shop run by the Devil.

Meanwhile, Jerry and Morty are transported to Pluto due to Jerry's opinions on Pluto's planetary status.
