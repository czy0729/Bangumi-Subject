In his room, Randy becomes emotional watching military homecoming videos on the internet. Derrick then mentions that his girlfriend Erin, a single mother whose ex-husband is deployed, is upset because she can't take her son Sam (Rob Lamer) to Walt Disney World for his birthday. Derrick offers to take Sam in her place, but all Sam wants is for his father to come home. Randy indirectly convinces Cody to call in some favors to get Sam's father home after suggesting a homecoming ceremony at the football game. At the game, the Army does terribly, but is able to score one touchdown, winning Cody his bet with Diggins. After the game, Sam's father comes onto the field and embraces both Sam and Erin. Derrick thinks the two will now get back together, but Erin then embraces Derrick even stronger for what he did for Sam. Pete and Derrick show Randy a reunion tape with their father that took place while their mother was still pregnant with Randy.","status":"Air"},{"id":358832,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/358832","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Rear D Day","name_cn":"","duration":"00:21:34","airdate":"2014-02-07","comment":0,"desc":"Pete and his unit offer to do home improvements for an obnoxious father (Andrew Daly) and his reclusive son (Drew Justice) while their wife/mother is deployed.
