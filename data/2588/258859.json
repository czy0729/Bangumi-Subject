{"id":258859,"type":2,"name":"Farmer Al Falfa See's New York","summary":"Farmer Al Falfa goes to New York, money bag in hand. He is immediately spotted by a crook who dispatches a fetching lady to shake him down. At a restaurant, she gets him drunk and lays him out with knockout drops. But what's in the bag is not what she is expecting, and she flees. The now-drunken farmer has stepped dizzily outside to acquaint himself with a lamppost when another sharper steps up and hauls him into a crooked card game. While prospects do not look good for Farmer Al Falfa, he has more tricks up his sleeve than the city slickers realize.","info":"<li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>导演: </span><a href=\"/person/33235\" rel=\"v:directedBy\">Paul Terry</a></li><li><span>原画: </span><a href=\"/person/33234\">J.R.
