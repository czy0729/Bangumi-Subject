It consists of 300 individually painted images and lasts about 10 minutes. It was the second film that Reynaud made for his Théâtre Optique, after Un bon bock (created in 1888).\r\n\r\nThe film shows a clown entering a circus ring and greeting the audience, before he starts to perform tricks with three dogs. The dogs jump through hoops, walk on a ball and jump over a wand.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>小丑和他的狗</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>导演: </span><a href=\"/person/17963\" rel=\"v:directedBy\">Charles-Émile Reynaud</a></li><li><span>脚本: </span><a href=\"/person/17963\">Charles-Émile Reynaud</a></li><li><span>原画: </span><a href=\"/person/17963\">Charles-Émile Reynaud</a></li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1892年10月28日</li><li><span>片长: </span>5min</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"考古","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":913712,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/913712","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":17963,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/fc/cb/17963_prsn_CLZYY.jpg","name":"埃米尔·雷纳德","desc":"导演"}]}
