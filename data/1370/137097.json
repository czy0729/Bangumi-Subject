Using nothing more than cheap decorative beads, we are given a short history on the development of the animal side of nature. The end of \"The Bead Game\" was powerful statement on how animalistic and brutal humans are toward one another. In the twenty-five years since this short film was made, humans have advanced their intelligence in the areas of weaponry, brutality, and violence. It seems the most obvious and significant advance has been the marketing of mass media that seems to glorify violence. \"The Bead Game\" stands a sort of a testament and a warning that humanity is on a doomed path if we continue forth in the areas of war and destruction. I give this animated masterpiece a 10 out of 10! \r\n　　PS: There are laws of war and revolution. One is the law of unintented consequences. You have to bevery careful when you come upon a proverbial Pandora's Box. Once you choose that open that box, you don't completely expect every aftershock that will be wrought from it and it will take a very long time to overcome them","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>串珠游戏</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1977</li><li><span>片长: </span>5:29</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>加拿大</li><li><span>语言: </span>无对白</li><li><span>导演: </span>Ishu Patel</li>","collection":{"collect":6,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"1977","count":2},{"name":"短片","count":2},{"name":"1970s","count":1},{"name":"欧美","count":1}]}
