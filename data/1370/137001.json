This one is pretty strange even for Condie! I am seldom at a loss for words, but trying to describe this one and do it justice is difficult. This airs somewhat frequently on O Canada on the Cartoon Network. The show itself is well worth watching. Catch this one if you can. Highly recommended!","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>学徒</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1991</li><li><span>片长: </span>8:39</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>加拿大</li><li><span>语言: </span>无对白</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧 / 动画 / 短片</li><li><span>导演: </span>Richard Condie</li>","collection":{"collect":5,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"无对白","count":1},{"name":"加拿大","count":1},{"name":"怪诞","count":1},{"name":"短片","count":1}]}
