Using very basic and deceptively simple hand-drawn animation (incorporating some very entertaining visual tricks along the way) this tells, in effect, two stories: the story the children see and the probable reality the audience may well ascertain from the same \"facts\". A bit like Rashomon, but with only one recounting onscreen. Deservedly won a BAFTA, if I recall correctly. Well worth tracking down. Most recommended.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>明眸男子</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2000-10-17</li><li><span>片长: </span>5分钟</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>导演: </span>Jonathan Hodgson</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Charles Bukowski</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":4,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"冷门","count":1},{"name":"短片","count":1}]}
