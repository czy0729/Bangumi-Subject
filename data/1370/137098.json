Then, as the couple slowly undresses and readies for bed, the film gets WEIRD!!! The talk and talk about how they didn't like the couple who left (despite acting very chummy when the film started) and complained that the couple are so fake!! This hypocrisy is great, because as they whine about this couple and how they are jerks, Norma and Milton slowly begin revealing their own hypocrisy--in a very grisly way. However, it would truly spoil the film to say more, so I'll wrap it up by saying that the payoff was worth it. A nice and insightful picture.","info":"<li><span>上映年度: </span>1988</li><li><span>片长: </span>5:53</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>美国 / 加拿大</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>导演: </span>John Schnall</li><li><span>主演: </span>Ilona Dulaski / Peter Shawn</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":2,"dropped":3}}
