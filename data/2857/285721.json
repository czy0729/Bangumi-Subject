Instead, she's enlisted by former employer/part-time paramour Charlie Baudelaire to steal a ring from an Eastern European overlord named Miljan Bestic, living in Cuba. Jett won't agree to the job without her former partner Quinn, a safecracker who's still serving three years in the slammer, so Baudelaire engineers an escape involving the kidnapping of a prison warden's wife. After running into Jack Dillon, an undercover cop with a vested interest in Baudelaire and his loose-cannon son Junior, Jett travels to Cuba with Quinn, where the pair embarks on a dangerous cat-and-mouse game with Bestic.","status":"Air"},{"id":894589,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/894589","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Charles Junior","name_cn":"","duration":"01:00:01","airdate":"2019-06-21","comment":0,"desc":"Shaken from her job in Cuba, Jett is approached by a Bestic subordinate, Evans, about masterminding a heist at the site of a high-stakes poker game.
