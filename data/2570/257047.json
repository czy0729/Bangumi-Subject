The game features Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse trying to figure out why everyone in the circus has disappeared, and includes four different types of outfits and six different levels. While the SNES and Genesis/Mega Drive versions were practically identical, the GBA re-release in 2003 included some new features. As its predecessor, it received praise for its graphics and outfit system and was criticized for not being challenging enough and short. Notably, it was the first game with Minnie Mouse in a video game role.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>米老鼠-神秘马戏团</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Disney's Magical Quest 2 Starring Mickey & Minnie</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>ミッキーとミニー マジカルアドベンチャー2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>米奇和米妮的魔法大冒险2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>米老鼠2-神秘马戏团</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GBA</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年11月11日</li>","staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":249921,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a3/c2/249921_12Xof.jpg","title":"ミッキーのマジカルアドベンチャー","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/249921"},{"id":257052,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/40/56/257052_Yez8k.jpg","title":"Disney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey & Donald","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/257052"}]}
