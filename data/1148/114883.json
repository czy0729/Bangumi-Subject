In some of us, that dream never died. Some of us kept dreaming: what if the whole street was jello? Or the continent? The world!? The Floor is Jelly posits a universe made of jello, made purely for one's own amusement. No longer need we look to our walls and our floors and sigh, \"How solid! How sadly immalleable! How I wish for a world consisting only of Non-Newtonian fluids!\" That world has arrived, via the dark magic of videogames, as The Floor is Jelly.
