Poptropica was primarily the creation of Jeff Kinney, the author of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. As of 2015, he remains at the company as the Creative Director.\r\n\r\nIn the game, players can go to different 'islands' (game quest scenarios), compete in multiplayer games, and communicate with each other. The islands all have various difficulties, but all center on a problem that the player must resolve by going through multiple obstacles or completing goals. All islands, upon finishing, award \"Poptropica credits\" which are non-negotiable but may be used to buy costumes and special effects in the Poptropica store.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>Web</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Educational, Adventure</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2007年9月</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.poptropica.com/</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
