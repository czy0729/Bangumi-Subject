{"id":213777,"type":2,"name":"X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/90/f3/213777_u74KO.jpg","summary":"The title is a pun on the name of Kitty Pryde, the youngest of the X-Men. The series that this episode was intended to launch never materialized; Marvel Productions would have to go back to the drawing board for 1992’s X-Men. Funding for this pilot actually came from the budget for RoboCop: The Animated Series. Instead of making a 13th episode of RoboCop, Marvel Productions decided to use their funding to have Toei Animation produce the animation for this pilot. The pilot itself is most specifically influenced by issues #129-139 of Uncanny X-Men.\r\n\r\nShortly after this pilot was delivered, Marvel started having financial issues (New World Pictures, who purchased the Marvel Entertainment Group or MEG from Cadence Industries in 1986, sold MEG in January 1989 to the Andrews Group) and stopped work on just about everything but Muppet Babies. This pilot effectively marked the end of the Marvel animated universe created by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises/Marvel Productions, which began with Fantastic Four (1978) and continued with Spider-Woman (1979), Spider-Man (1981), Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (1981) and The Incredible Hulk (1982). The X-Men themselves had previously guest starred in several episodes of Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, although that particular series isn't necessarily in the same continuity as \"Pryde of the X-Men\".","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>X战警：幻影猫</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>1989-09-16</li><li><span>原作: </span><a href=\"/person/25729\">Stan Lee</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Pryde of the X-Men</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>First-run syndication</li>","collection":{"collect":2,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"无","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":715381,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/715381","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"crt":[{"id":77966,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/cf/d2/77966_crt_5Y9yy.jpg","name":"金刚狼","desc":"主角"}],"staff":[{"id":25729,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5c/7c/25729_prsn_1n1Rj.jpg","name":"斯坦·李","desc":"原作"}],"relations":[{"id":130059,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9d/b3/130059_xX39j.jpg","title":"X-Men","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/130059"}]}
