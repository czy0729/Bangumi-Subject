Released in the U.S. at the same time as the animated Italian feature I Fratelli Dinamite, La Rosa di Bagdad demonstrated that Disney held no monopoly on clever cartoonery. Inspired by The Arabian Nights, the story concerns a beautiful princess, a poor-but-honest hero, an evil sultan, and a slave of the lamp. Reviewers in 1949 were taken by director Anton Gino Domeghini's clever choice of camera angles and by Riccardo Pick-Mangiagalli's musical score.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>歌唱公主</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>总导演: </span><a href=\"/person/28553\">Anton Gino Domenighini</a></li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1949</li><li><span>片长: </span>76min</li><li><span>其他: </span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rosa_di_Bagdad</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"europe","count":1},{"name":"无","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":913520,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/913520","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":28553,"image":"","name":"安东·基诺·多美尼基尼","desc":"总导演"}]}
