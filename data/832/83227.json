The main difference from traditional pinball game is the ability to influence Sonic's movement somewhat while moving, although flippers are still the primary source of movement. In a few rare instances, the player can control Sonic on foot, but for the majority of the time he is rolled into a ball and controlled by the flippers.\r\n\r\nThe game features four large pinball tables: a sewer level, a geothermal power station, a robot factory, and a launchpad system. The player must guide Sonic through each of the four levels and collect all of the Chaos Emeralds, then fight Dr. Robotnik. Once all of the Chaos Emeralds in a level are collected, Sonic gains access to the boss room and has to defeat a boss to advance onwards. Sonic will lose a life if he falls into certain traps such as lava, slime, or monsters, and the game ends when the player loses all their lives.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Sonic Spinball</li><li><span>平台: </span>DC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>IOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>XBOX360</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GG</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SMS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>XBOX</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>平台跳跃</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年11月15日</li>","collection":{"collect":3,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":19173,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5b/d7/19173_YU86y.jpg","title":"Sonic the Hedgehog","type":"不同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/19173"}]}
