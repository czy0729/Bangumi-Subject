Only when his mother dies in one of these farms, Iro realizes he has the power to change the order of things.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>伊罗英雄</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Switch</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2018年7月30日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://irohero.com</li><li><span>开发: </span>Artax Games</li><li><span>发行: </span>Artax Games</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"PS4","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}]}
