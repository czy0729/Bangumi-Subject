It's been in-development since 2002 and released for Microsoft Windows, Linux and OS X. Following a cease and desist notice from \"Doom\" trademark owner, ZeniMax Media, the game's name was changed to DRL in 2016.\r\nDRL is turn-based, offers a top-down interface formed entirely of ASCII characters, and features a character leveling system with traits. As it is based upon Doom, the game is more fast-paced and combat-oriented than usual for a roguelike, and relies heavily on ranged rather than melee combat. A limited player inventory, non-stackable items, and other design choices contrast with the often extreme intricacy of games in its genre.
