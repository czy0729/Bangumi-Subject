It is an endless loop: you can finish it, but also find the way to continue past the ending and get the highest score!  \r\n\r\nSpace shooters were never that punchy before. Task Force Kampas emphasizes music and game feel to create the perfect game you'd want to spend all your coins into (if that were still a thing, you know.)  \r\n\r\nThe story revolves about a team of outcasts fighting for their future, who happened to be at the worst place during the Evil Invasion. Can you contain the breach? Can you save the whole universe before it becomes corrupted? More importantly, can you save your friends?","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>タスクフォース カンパス</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Switch</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019年2月22日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://casiopea.itch.io/taskforcekampas</li><li><span>开发: </span>Casiopea</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"PS4","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}]}
