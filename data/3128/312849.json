In the game, the player controls a blue racecar that must collect all of the yellow flags in each stage, while avoiding red enemy cars and rocks. A radar is displayed at the right of the screen, showing the location of the player, remaining flags and enemies, alongside a fuel meter that gradually depletes as the stage progresses. Enemy cars can be stunned by releasing smoke screens, which will deplete the fuel meter. It was licensed out to Midway Games for released in North America. It ran on the Namco Pac-Man arcade board.\r\n\r\nRally-X was one of Namco's first video games to be exported outside Japan, due to their business relations with Midway. It was presented at the Amusement Machine Operator's Union of America trade show in North America, alongside Namco's own Pac-Man and Williams' Defender. Despite rumors that executives claimed Rally-X would be the most successful, Namco's marketing team heavily promoted the game during its test run, where it would gain just as much praise as Pac-Man.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a>（日本）、<a href=\"/person/32718\">Midway Games</a>（北美）</li><li><span>美工: </span><a href=\"/person/39414\">小野浩</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/39140\">甲斐敏夫</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ラリーX</li><li><span>平台: </span>VIC-20</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MSX</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Maze</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1980年11月</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":1598,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9c/19/1598_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"南梦宫","desc":"开发"},{"id":32718,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/14/80/32718_prsn_HD7Yl.jpg","name":"Midway Games","desc":"发行"},{"id":39414,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ef/c1/39414_prsn_deFCE.jpg","name":"小野浩","desc":"美工"},{"id":39140,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/3b/ce/39140_prsn_MagGH.jpg","name":"甲斐敏夫","desc":"音乐"}]}
