As dusk falls, he follows a blockade runner into port, pretending to be the Flame. Then, once the two vessels are moored, he captures it and takes it out to sea. He then pursues the Flame, which retreats to the French port. Believing the mutineers responsible, the French send four gunboats to take her. Hornblower manages to exploit the fighting to capture both the Flame and a gunboat, and killing the ringleader of the mutiny in the bargain.\r\n\r\nHe then sends a force, to blow up French barges and ammunition. He puts his best friend, Captain William Bush, in command. The raid is a success and the French force is stopped, but an unexpected explosion kills most of the British, including Bush.\r\n\r\nWith Napoleon's surrender, Hornblower is raised to the peerage.
