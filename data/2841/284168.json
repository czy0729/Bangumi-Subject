But with daring raids against the French army and navy to be made, it will take all Hornblower's seamanship and stewardship to steer a steady course to victory and home. This is the sixth of eleven books chronicling the adventures of C. S. Forester's inimitable nautical hero, Horatio Hornblower.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>战列舰</li><li><span>册数: </span>1</li><li><span>作者: </span><a href=\"/person/34855\">C.S.
