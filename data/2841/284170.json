Published in 1945, it was the fourth Horatio Hornblower book to be written. By internal chronology, it is the ninth in the series. \r\n\r\nThe Admiralty puts Commodore Horatio Hornblower in command of a squadron and sends him on a diplomatic and military mission to the Baltic. His primary aim is to bring Russia into the war against Napoleon.\r\n\r\nHornblower is shown dealing with the problems of squadron command, and using naval mortars (carried on special ships known as bomb-ketches to destroy a French privateer. This leads to the French invasion of Swedish Pomerania. Later his squadron calls at Kronstadt, where he meets with Russian officials, including Tsar Alexander I, who is favourably impressed by Hornblower and his squadron.\r\n\r\nAfter Russia enters the war, Hornblower's squadron takes an important role in the Defence of Riga, which is besieged by French forces. The bomb vessels again take an important role, and so do amphibious operations under the protection of the squadron. The siege is finally broken, and Hornblower joins the pursuit of the French armies on horseback, only to fall seriously ill with typhus.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege and pursuit, a German officer in Russian service, the later famous Carl von Clausewitz, is a character.
