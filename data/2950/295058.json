It was originally released for the PlayStation in Japan on December 12, 1999, and was later released in Europe on September 1, 2000. Although the original PlayStation port was never released in North America, the game was re-released on PlayStation Network in North America in 2014.\r\n\r\nThe game was unique in that the software loaded into RAM, letting the player use any music CD to play against; the game could generate a unique level from any track. The graphics for Vib-Ribbon are simple, consisting of straight, white vector lines forming crude, angular drawings of the level and the player character, named Vibri.
