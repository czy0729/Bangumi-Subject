{"id":88601,"type":4,"name":"Pool of Radiance","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/31/39/88601_WYQ29.jpg","summary":"Pool of Radiance is a role-playing video game developed and published by Strategic Simulations, Inc (SSI) in 1988. It was the first adaptation of TSR's Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D or D&D) fantasy role-playing game for home computers, becoming the first episode in a four-part series of D&D computer adventure games. The other games in the \"Gold Box\" series used the game engine pioneered in Pool of Radiance, as did later D&D titles such as the Neverwinter Nights online game. Pool of Radiance takes place in the Forgotten Realms fantasy setting, with the action centered in and around the port city of Phlan.\r\nJust as in traditional D&D games, the player starts by building a party of up to six characters, deciding the race, sex, class and ability scores for each. The player's party is enlisted to help the settled part of the city by clearing out the marauding inhabitants that have taken over the surroundings. The characters move on from one area to another, battling bands of enemies as they go and ultimately confronting the powerful leader of the evil forces. During play the player characters gain experience points, which allow them to increase their capabilities. The game primarily uses a first-person perspective, with the screen divided into sections to display pertinent textual information. During combat sequences, the display switches to a top-down \"video game isometric\" view.\r\nGenerally well received by the gaming press, Pool of Radiance won the Origins Award for \"Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988\". Some reviewers criticized the game's similarities to other contemporary games and its slowness in places, but praised the game's graphics and its role-playing adventure and combat aspects. Also well-regarded was the ability to export player characters from Pool of Radiance to subsequent SSI games in the series.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>光芒之池</li><li><span>美工: </span><a href=\"/person/6316\">神谷盛治</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Gold Box</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1988年6月</li><li><span>开发: </span>Strategic Simulations, Inc.</li><li><span>发行: </span>Strategic Simulations, Inc.</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"D&D","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":6316,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6e/ae/6316_prsn_p7wLV.jpg","name":"神谷盛治","desc":"美工"}],"relations":[{"id":136492,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/57/98/136492_C0dgB.jpg","title":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/136492"},{"id":88602,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/2a/98/88602_RfJ8m.jpg","title":"Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/88602"},{"id":61614,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/97/09/61614_Y5BQ0.jpg","title":"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/61614"},{"id":759,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/fa/14/759_sJPgn.jpg","title":"Neverwinter Nights 2","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/759"},{"id":3035,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/03/bf/3035_dZc2m.jpg","title":"Baldur's Gate II: Shadow of Amn","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/3035"},{"id":55109,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/8a/fb/55109_5rcB4.jpg","title":"Baldur's Gate:Enhanced Edition","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/55109"},{"id":7623,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/47/7b/7623_1wQDr.jpg","title":"Icewind Dale","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/7623"},{"id":3034,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/7b/66/3034_M2aZK.jpg","title":"Baldur's Gate","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/3034"},{"id":80862,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f4/af/80862_Z7fDC.jpg","title":"Icewind Dale 2","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/80862"},{"id":253452,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/dc/75/253452_id1iI.jpg","title":"Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/253452"},{"id":269022,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b3/50/206822_RnrUu.jpg","title":"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/269022"},{"id":256941,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/53/b6/256941_Bner3.jpg","title":"Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/256941"},{"id":757,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/47/0e/757_56K3Z.jpg","title":"Neverwinter Nights","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/757"},{"id":88428,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/25/c1/88428_QmGJ2.jpg","title":"Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/88428"},{"id":126210,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4d/a8/126210_iOR90.jpg","title":"The Temple of Elemental Evil","type":"不同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126210"},{"id":2213,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/01/89/2213_Q9Wki.jpg","title":"Planescape: Torment","type":"不同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/2213"},{"id":218786,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3b/0e/218786_9x6Fw.jpg","title":"Planescape: Torment Enhanced Edition","type":"不同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/218786"}]}
