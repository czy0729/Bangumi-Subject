There are five races to choose from: humans, elves, dwarves, orks, and trolls. The player can choose to play as one of six classes, Street Samurai, Mage, Decker, Shaman, Rigger, or Physical Adept, or the player can choose to play as no class at all. Street Samurai focus on combat and weapons, Mages use various spells including attack spells, healing spells and others, Deckers focus on hacking into computer systems, Shamans can summon spirits to aid in battle, Riggers control robotic drones that can specialize in combat or healing, while Physical Adepts use their magic spells to make themselves stronger in various ways.\r\nAs the story progresses, the player is given Karma to spend on improving their characters. While classes control what skills and equipment the character starts with, the player can choose to gain any skills they wish (e.g., Deckers can spend Karma to gain a Shaman's summoning abilities). The main statistics are Body, Quickness, Strength, Intelligence, Willpower and Charisma. Besides the player character, the player can hire up to three other runners to aid the character during missions and some characters are required to follow the character during certain missions.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>暗影狂奔 归来</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13928\">Paradox Interactive</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>IOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>战略角色扮演</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unity</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2013-07-25</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun</li><li><span>开发: </span>Harebrained Schemes</li>","collection":{"wish":8,"collect":11,"doing":1,"on_hold":2,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":5},{"name":"SRPG","count":2},{"name":"EPIC","count":2},{"name":"RPG","count":2},{"name":"☆","count":1},{"name":"2013","count":1},{"name":"重制？","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":13928,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/4a/66/13928_prsn_4ggz8.jpg","name":"悖论交互","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":52524,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/32/0d/52524_M1AFL.jpg","title":"Shadowrun","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/52524"},{"id":145331,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b7/08/145331_0iIAz.jpg","title":"Shadowrun: Dragonfall","type":"资料片、外传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/145331"},{"id":145330,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ed/6f/145330_0501J.jpg","title":"Shadowrun: Hong Kong","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/145330"},{"id":88625,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/78/02/88625_u5bBB.jpg","title":"シャドウラン","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/88625"},{"id":88623,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/68/71/88623_N7j83.jpg","title":"Shadowrun (1993 video game)","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/88623"},{"id":88624,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/09/af/88624_eTC6e.jpg","title":"Shadowrun (1994 video game)","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/88624"}]}
