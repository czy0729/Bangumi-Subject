Except Dungeon Master has still arguably done it better. Everything about the game is immersive. The beautiful (for the time) 3D graphics, the haunting sound, and the surprisingly deep mythology makes you feel like you're really exploring a dungeon. And unlike other 3D dungeon crawlers of the time, it was real-time; you had to stay on your toes if you wanted to survive.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>地下城主</li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/39902\">多和田吏</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Apple II</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1987年</li><li><span>发行: </span>Software Heaven</li><li><span>开发: </span>FTL Games</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"staff":[{"id":39902,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/7c/04/39902_prsn_P8pk9.jpg","name":"多和田吏","desc":"音乐"}]}
