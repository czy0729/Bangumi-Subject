It was originally released for the Neo Geo MVS arcade cabinet on July 28, 1992. It is ADK's first game in the fighting game genre, as well as their earliest attempt in the fighting game trend of the '90s that was popularized by Capcom's 1991 arcade-hit Street Fighter II. It was even the last game with the \"Alpha\" logo labeled within the game before the developer became \"ADK\"; however, the \"Alpha\" logo was last used on one of the arcade flyers of its sequel.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>世界英雄</li><li><span>开发: </span>アルファ電子(ADK)、<a href=\"/person/705\">SNK</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>WORLD HEROES</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NEO GEO</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1-2</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年7月28日</li><li><span>发行: </span>アルファ電子(ADK)</li>","collection":{"collect":5,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARCADE","count":2},{"name":"ARC","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":705,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a5/82/705_prsn_o7m1w.jpg","name":"SNK","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":301326,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0a/c2/301326_PPrEM.jpg","title":"ワールドヒーローズ2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/301326"},{"id":262567,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/68/6c/262567_GiWu8.jpg","title":"ネオジオバトルコロシアム","type":"角色出演","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/262567"}]}
