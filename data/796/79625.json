The game follows the typical manic shooter/bullet hell concept - players (up to two in co-op) fly forward on hover bikes and shoot enemies while trying to avoid many projectiles fired at them. Vasara has three playable characters: Yukimura Sanada, Keiji Maeda, and Saiga Magoichi - each specializing in a different weapon. Besides the standard shot, screen clearing bombs and charge attacks are available. Defeating or damaging enemies with the charge attacks makes red gems appear. Picking these up fills a \"Vasara\" meter, turning the charge attack into a super attack. Another unique feature is that players (and enemies) don't die after collisions. The game features six stages and several bosses to kill.\r\n","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>婆娑罗</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/16224\">ビスコ</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/16224\">ビスコ</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Vasara</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>纵版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2000年</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"VISCO","count":1},{"name":"ARCADE","count":1},{"name":"2000","count":1},{"name":"ARC","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":16224,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/f6/bb/16224_prsn_i66po.jpg","name":"比斯寇","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":261753,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b2/29/261753_FymPK.jpg","title":"婆裟羅2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/261753"}]}
