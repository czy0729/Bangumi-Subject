The player, Trent, is a lone hero who will save the universe from an evil force.\r\nIt enjoyed a degree of success in arcades and was subsequently ported to the Mega Drive by Toaplan on May 31, 1991, in Japan, and by Sega during the following year in Europe, followed by a Japan-only release by Naxat Soft on September 18, 1992, for the PC Engine's CD-ROM².\r\nThe European version of the Mega Drive port was the source for \"All your base are belong to us\", an Internet meme which plays off the poorly translated English in the game's introduction.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>零翼战机</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32899\">TOAPLAN</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32899\">TOAPLAN</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>零式战机</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>ゼロウィング</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PCE CD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>横版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1989年9月</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":3,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARCADE","count":2}],"staff":[{"id":32899,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/15/96/32899_prsn_g1eP7.jpg","name":"TOAPLAN","desc":"开发"}]}
