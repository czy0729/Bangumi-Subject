Like many other scrolling shooters, the game is set in outer space, where the player takes control of a small spaceship across several planets. The game is played with an eight-way joystick and two buttons (a shot and a bomb button) through five large levels and their bosses (which then loop forever, at higher difficulties).","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>宇宙达人</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32899\">TOAPLAN</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/7482\">Taito</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Truxton</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>达人王</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>たつじん</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PCE</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>纵版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人 (交互)</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1988年10月</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARCADE","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":32899,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/15/96/32899_prsn_g1eP7.jpg","name":"TOAPLAN","desc":"开发"},{"id":7482,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/54/d7/7482_prsn_Ad23D.jpg","name":"太东","desc":"发行"}]}
