The game was released in Japan in October 1999 and worldwide in 2000, and re-released in Japan in September 2011, in Europe in November 2012, and in North America in November 2015. The game is a sequel to Tomba! and centers on the exploits of a pink-haired feral child named Tomba as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend Tabby from a race of anthropomorphic and antagonistic pigs. The game was received positively by critics, with particular praise going to the visuals and varied objective-based gameplay, with more mixed reception directed toward the audio. Whoopee Camp disbanded following the game's lackluster commercial performance.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>东巴2</li><li><span>别名: </span>Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Tombi! 2: The Evil Swine Return</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Tomba: The Wild Adventures</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PSN</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1999年10月28日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Whoopee Camp</li><li><span>发行: </span>Whoopee Camp</li>","relations":[{"id":237154,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e9/91/237154_ZMeea.jpg","title":"オレっ!トンバ","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/237154"}]}
