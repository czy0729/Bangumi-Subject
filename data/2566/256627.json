It was developed by the game studio SingleTrac, published by Sony, and released in 1996 for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows.\r\nThe Microsoft Windows version features slightly cut-down graphics compared to the PlayStation version but doesn't require a 3D accelerator video card. It also features multiplayer mode over a modem line or Internet.\r\nTwo years after its release, Twisted Metal 2 was re-released as a PlayStation Greatest Hits game, however under the developer 989 Studios instead of SingleTrac. It was also released for download in Japan and North America on the PlayStation Network in 2007.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>烈火战车2</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1018\">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1018\">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>旋转钢铁2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Twisted Metal: World Tour</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Twisted Metal EX</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PSN</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Vehicular combat</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996年10月31日</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"staff":[{"id":1018,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/37/28/1018_prsn_Yvv5n.jpg","name":"索尼互动娱乐","desc":"开发"}]}
