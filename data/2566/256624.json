It is the first game in the Syphon Filter series, the plot centres on special agents Gabriel \"Gabe\" Logan and Lian Xing who are tasked by the United States government to apprehend an international terrorist from Germany.\r\nDevelopment on Syphon Filter began with the intention of creating a new \"super-spy\" genre hybrid that contained elements of stealth-action and puzzle solving. The game was almost cancelled several times during development as Eidetic faced many difficulties due to the lack of inspiration from others and their inexperience in creating video games. Despite the initial drawbacks faced, Syphon Filter was met with positive reviews from critics upon release, mostly directed at its innovation and immersive plot.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>虹吸战士</li><li><span>别名: </span>虹吸战士1</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>TPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1999年2月17日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Eidetic</li><li><span>发行: </span>989 Studios</li>","relations":[{"id":256634,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c5/0d/256634_3ZhNh.jpg","title":"Syphon Filter 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/256634"}]}
