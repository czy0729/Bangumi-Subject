{"id":140548,"type":4,"name":"Dofus","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/71/41/140548_LVVQf.jpg","summary":"Dofus is a Flash based massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Ankama Games, a French computer game manufacturer. Originally released solely in French, it has since been translated into many other languages. It is primarily a Pay to Play game, though it still offers a limited amount of free content. Its success has led to the marketing of spin-off products, such as books, art, comics and a movie which was planned for release in 2013. It has also led to the development of two continuations: Dofus Arena, released at the beginning of 2006, which is an alternative \"tournament\" version of Dofus; and Wakfu, a continuation of Dofus. The game has attracted over 10 million players worldwide and is especially well known in France.","info":"<li><span>游戏类型: </span>MMORPG</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Flash</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>多人在线</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2004年9月</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>www.dofus.com</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"法国","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":141620,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/33/8d/141620_8B1Ss.jpg","title":"Dofus aux trésors de Kérubim","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/141620"},{"id":186947,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e9/cb/186947_zFjEl.jpg","title":"Dofus, livre 1 : Julith","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/186947"},{"id":101304,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/7e/8b/101304_f7NeT.jpg","title":"Wakfu","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/101304"}]}
