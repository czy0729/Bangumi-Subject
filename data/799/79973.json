It features classic cartoon characters Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy Goof, and Pluto Pup in contemporary settings such as Paris and New York. The series will have the slapstick feel of classic Mickey Mouse shorts, as well as place the titular character in humorous situations that showcase his pluck and rascality, along with his long-beloved charm and good hearted-ness. It is being executive produced and directed by Emmy Award-winning artist Paul Rudish, known for his work on the Cartoon Network series Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls. It was announced at Disney's upfront meeting on March 12, 2013 for a premiere on June 28 on Disney Channel, with a total of 19 episodes, the first of which was made available on Disney's website as a \"special preview\".","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>米老鼠2013 第一季</li><li><span>话数: </span>18</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2013年6月28日</li><li><span>製作: </span><a href=\"/person/6816\">Walt Disney
