It was written by Doug Neubauer, an Atari employee, and released in cartridge form by Atari in 1979. The game is commonly referred to as the platform's killer app. It was later ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari ST.\r\n\r\nThe game simulates 3D space combat between the player's ship and an invading fleet of alien \"Zylon\" vessels. Star Raiders was distinctive for its graphics, which, in addition to various map and long range scan views, provided forward and aft first-person views, with movement conveyed by a streaming 3D starfield as the player engaged enemy spacecraft.\r\n\r\nWhile there had already been target-shooting games using the first person perspective (including 1978's Cosmic Conflict), Star Raiders had considerably higher quality graphics and more complex gameplay. It inspired imitators throughout the 1980s as well as later-generation space combat simulation games. It is one of the games that inspired Elite, Wing Commander, and Star Wars: X-Wing.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Star Raiders was included in a list of the 10 most important video games of all time, as compiled by Stanford University's History of Science and Technology Collections.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>星际突击者</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a>、<a href=\"/person/39174\">Atari Corporation</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Atari ST</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 5200</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 400/800</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Space combat simulator</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1979年</li><li><span>其他发行日期: </span>1982年9月(Atari 2600)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">其他发行日期: </span>1986年(Atari ST)</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Doug Neubauer</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"},{"id":39174,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/38/4e/39174_prsn_89qQW.jpg","name":"雅达利（1984-1996）","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":317837,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5d/10/317837_jCHxJ.jpg","title":"Star Raiders II","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/317837"},{"id":314877,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/01/2b/314877_9I79y.jpg","title":"Atari Force","type":"书籍","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/314877"}]}
