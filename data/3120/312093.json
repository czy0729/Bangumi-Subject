{"id":312093,"type":4,"name":"Warlords","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/fc/91/312093_PjpNn.jpg","summary":"Warlords is an arcade game released by Atari, Inc. in 1980. The game resembles a combination of Breakout and Quadrapong (an early Atari arcade game) in the sense that not only can up to four players play the game at the same time, but also the \"castles\" in the four corners of the screen are brick walls that could be broken with a flaming ball.\r\n\r\nWarlords uses spinner controllers for player control, and came in both an upright two player version and a four player cocktail version. The upright version uses a black and white monitor, and reflects the game image onto a mirror, with a backdrop of castles, giving the game a 3D feel. The upright version only supports up to two simultaneous players, which move through the levels as a team. The cocktail version is in color, and supports 1–4 players. Three-to-four player games are free-for-alls where the game ends as soon as one player wins. One-to-two player games play identical to the upright version.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1980年</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
