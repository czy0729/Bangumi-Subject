A first-person flight simulator game, the player takes the role of a World War I ace in a biplane fighting on the side of the Allies. The game is named after the nickname of Manfred von Richthofen, German flying ace. The game utilizes the same monochrome vector graphics and similar arcade hardware as Atari's own immensely popular Battlezone; both were developed at the same time. Like Battlezone, the player is presented with a first-person view of the action.
