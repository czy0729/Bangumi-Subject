It is based on a single screen of four concentric roadways, much like Sega's 1979 Head On arcade game. Sears released the game for the \"Sears Video Arcade\" under the name Dodger Cars.\r\n\r\nThe Dodge 'Em cartridge includes three versions of the game, accessible through the Game Select switch on the Atari 2600. The first game is for one player, and the remaining two are for two players. The second game has the two players, one player playing the role of the player's car, alternating turns. In the third game, one player plays one car the other player controls the other car at the same time, alternating turns.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Maze</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1980年</li><li><span>程序: </span>Carla Meninsky</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
