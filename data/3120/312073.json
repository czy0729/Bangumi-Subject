{"id":312073,"type":4,"name":"Video Chess","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/86/cc/312073_nOZS6.jpg","summary":"This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.\r\n\r\nTo castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.\r\n\r\nAnother maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square. To carry out the en passant, you must advance your pawn to the fifth rank. Your opponent then has the option of moving his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two squares. If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.\r\n\r\n简介引用自Mobygames。","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>程序: </span><a href=\"/person/39073\">Bob Whitehead</a>, Larry Wagner</li><li><span>平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>棋牌</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1979年夏</li><li><span>售价: </span>$40.00</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"},{"id":39073,"image":"","name":"Bob Whitehead","desc":"程序"}]}
