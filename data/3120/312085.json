This is a character-building story about a simple fisherman going all the way to become one of the masters of Shaolin. On this way he passes life trials, meets new people with their unique personalities, and learns about revenge and death. Some of the people he met become his friends, and some betray him. But despite all of the difficulties on the difficult path, he has chosen to strive to leave his mark on history by saving his homeland and the whole world from evil.\r\n\r\nAlthough the game world tries to adhere to real historical events, places, weapons and characters as much as possible, it also has magic, supernatural beings and other fantasy elements. This setting is the combination of real history with mysticism and fables, as it is customary in the Chinese fantasy genre of Wuxia.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>少林九武猴</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Beat 'em up</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2020-10-16</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://9monkeysofshaolin.com</li><li><span>开发: </span>Sobaka Studio</li><li><span>发行: </span>Buka Entertainment</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":1}]}
