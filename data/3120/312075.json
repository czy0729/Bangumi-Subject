It was developed by Atari, Inc. and released in August 1979. It was the most popular version to date of the \"Lunar Lander\" concept, surpassing the prior Moonlander and numerous text-based games, and most later versions of the concept are implicitly or explicitly based on the Atari version.\r\n\r\nThe player controls a lunar landing module viewed from the side and attempts to land safely on the Moon. The player burns fuel to rotate the module and fires a thruster to counteract gravity, attempting to gently land on marked areas. The scenario resets after every successful landing or crash, with new terrain, until no fuel remains. Coins can be inserted at any time to buy more fuel.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SIM 模拟飞行</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1979年8月</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Howard Delman, Rich Moore</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
