The world is 3D, but you always play from 2D perspectives. Each 3D world has 4 Sides. You can freely “rotate” your point of view in 90° increments between these 2D perspectives. This way, you will be able to navigate complex 3D environments, solve puzzles and find secrets! \r\n\r\nThe goal of the game is simply to explore and find treasures! FEZ features a huge open world, dense with secrets and mysteries. There are many different areas, all of which can be explored in any order. There are no enemies in FEZ. No bosses, no combat. In fact, no conflict of any kind. You can die, but there is no penalty for doing so. \r\n\r\nFEZ aims to create a non-threatening world rich with ambiance, a pleasant place to spend time in. \r\n\r\nFEZ was developed by Polytron, and is available on PC, Mac, Linux, Xbox Live Arcade, PS3, Vita, and PS4.\r\ncredits\r\nreleased 20 April 2012 \r\n\r\nWritten and Produced by Rich Vreeland \r\nMastered by Matthew Powell \r\nArtwork by Phil Fish","info":"<li><span>发售日期: </span>2012-04-20</li><li><span>价格: </span>$7 USD</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>1:17:57</li><li><span>碟片数量: </span>1</li><li><span>表演者: </span>Disasterpeace</li><li><span>流派: </span>电子</li><li><span>专辑类型: </span>专辑</li><li><span>介质: </span>CD,Digtial</li><li><span>出版者: </span>Polytron</li><li><span>条型码: </span>0885767032934</li><li><span>网站: </span>http://music.disasterpeace.com/album/fez-ost</li>","collection":{"collect":10,"doing":2},"tags":[{"name":"FEZ","count":2},{"name":"8bit","count":2},{"name":"Soundtrack","count":2},{"name":"indie","count":2},{"name":"菲斯","count":1},{"name":"chiptune","count":1},{"name":"videogame","count":1},{"name":"Electronic","count":1},{"name":"独立游戏","count":1},{"name":"游戏","count":1},{"name":"OST","count":1},{"name":"ambient","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Adventure","href":"/ep/447951"},{"title":"2 Puzzle","href":"/ep/447952"},{"title":"3 Beyond","href":"/ep/447953"},{"title":"4 Progress","href":"/ep/447954"},{"title":"5 Beacon","href":"/ep/447955"},{"title":"6 Flow","href":"/ep/447956"},{"title":"7 Formations","href":"/ep/447957"},{"title":"8 Legend","href":"/ep/447958"},{"title":"9 Compass","href":"/ep/447959"},{"title":"10 Forgotten","href":"/ep/447960"},{"title":"11 Sync","href":"/ep/447961"},{"title":"12 Glitch","href":"/ep/447962"},{"title":"13 Fear","href":"/ep/447963"},{"title":"14 Spirit","href":"/ep/447964"},{"title":"15 Nature","href":"/ep/447965"},{"title":"16 Knowledge","href":"/ep/447966"},{"title":"17 Death","href":"/ep/447967"},{"title":"18 Memory","href":"/ep/447968"},{"title":"19 Pressure","href":"/ep/447969"},{"title":"20 Nocturne","href":"/ep/447970"},{"title":"21 Age","href":"/ep/447971"},{"title":"22 Majesty","href":"/ep/447972"},{"title":"23 Continuum","href":"/ep/447973"},{"title":"24 Home","href":"/ep/447974"},{"title":"25 Reflection","href":"/ep/447975"},{"title":"26 Love","href":"/ep/447976"}]}],"relations":[{"id":57359,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/84/87/57359_19sQP.jpg","title":"FEZ","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/57359"}]}
