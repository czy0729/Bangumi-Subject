This is probably as close to an \"official\" soundtrack I'll ever make for the game World of Goo. I'm making it available here on my personal portfolio for free. I wrote much of this music specifically for the game, but many of the tracks were excerpts from music I had written previously for various small projects, or just for fun. This soundtrack includes the full versions of most of those songs, as best as I was able to recover them. Notes accompany the tracks below.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the instruments you'll hear are computer instruments, with a few live performances on top to add a bit of warmth. For the older music, I used one of those Sound Blaster cards that let you load samples into memory. More recently, I've been using the freeware sfz soundfont sampler. I have an m-audio keystation 49e midi keyboard for picking out melodies. Influences include Danny Elfman, Vangelis, Bernard Herrmann, Hans Zimmer, Ennio Morricone, and all the big movie guys. I grew up listening to them, and they remain a big influence in everything I write.\r\n\r\nThanks, and enjoy the music!\r\n\r\nKyle\r\n(at) kylegabler.com\r\n\r\nhttp://kylegabler.com/WorldOfGooSoundtrack/\r\n","info":"<li><span>发售日期: </span>2009</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>49:15</li><li><span>碟片数量: </span>1</li><li><span>表演者: </span>Kyle Gabler</li><li><span>专辑类型: </span>OST</li><li><span>介质: </span>数字</li><li><span>出版者: </span>self-released</li><li><span>网站: </span>http://kylegabler.com/WorldOfGooSoundtrack/</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":10},"tags":[{"name":"OST","count":5},{"name":"粘粘世界","count":2},{"name":"WorldOfGoo","count":2},{"name":"独立游戏","count":2},{"name":"indie","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 World of Goo Beginning","href":"/ep/447694"},{"title":"2 The Goo Filled Hills","href":"/ep/447695"},{"title":"3 Brave Adventurers","href":"/ep/447696"},{"title":"4 Another Mysterious Pipe Appeared","href":"/ep/447697"},{"title":"5 World of Goo Corporation","href":"/ep/447698"},{"title":"6 Regurgitation Pumping Station","href":"/ep/447699"},{"title":"7 Threadcutter","href":"/ep/447700"},{"title":"8 Rain Rain Windy Windy","href":"/ep/447701"},{"title":"9 Jelly","href":"/ep/447702"},{"title":"10 Tumbler","href":"/ep/447703"},{"title":"11 Screamer","href":"/ep/447704"},{"title":"12 Burning Man","href":"/ep/447705"},{"title":"13 Cog in the Machine","href":"/ep/447706"},{"title":"14 Happy New Year (tm) Brought to You by Product Z","href":"/ep/447707"},{"title":"15 Welcome to the Information Superhighway","href":"/ep/447708"},{"title":"16 Graphic Processing Unit","href":"/ep/447709"},{"title":"17 Years of Work","href":"/ep/447710"},{"title":"18 My Virtual World of Goo Corporation","href":"/ep/447711"},{"title":"19 Hello, MOM","href":"/ep/447712"},{"title":"20 Inside the Big Computer","href":"/ep/447713"},{"title":"21 Are You Coming Home, Love MOM","href":"/ep/447714"},{"title":"22 Ode to the Bridge Builder","href":"/ep/447715"},{"title":"23 The Last of the Goo Balls and the Telescope Operator","href":"/ep/447716"},{"title":"24 Best of Times","href":"/ep/447717"},{"title":"25 Red Carpet Extend-o-matic","href":"/ep/447718"},{"title":"26 World of Goo Corporation's Valued Customers","href":"/ep/447719"},{"title":"27 World of Goo Ending","href":"/ep/447720"}]}],"relations":[{"id":2397,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/87/8d/2397_3163G.jpg","title":"World of Goo","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/2397"}]}
