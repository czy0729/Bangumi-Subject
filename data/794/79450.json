The game was initially released in the arcades before it was ported to the Mega Drive/Genesis and the PC Engine CD-ROM² System, the latter under the name Hellfire S. Hellfire S contained notable differences from the other versions, including a remixed, more orchestral soundtrack, animated cut scenes, and the replacement of the leading male character Lancer with a female character called Kaoru (voiced by voice actress Yumi Tōma).","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>地狱火</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32899\">TOAPLAN</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32899\">TOAPLAN</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ヘルファイヤー</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Hellfire S</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PCE CD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>横版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1989年4月</li>","collection":{"collect":3,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARCADE","count":1},{"name":"TOAPLAN","count":1},{"name":"1989","count":1},{"name":"MD","count":1},{"name":"ARC","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":32899,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/15/96/32899_prsn_g1eP7.jpg","name":"TOAPLAN","desc":"开发"}]}
