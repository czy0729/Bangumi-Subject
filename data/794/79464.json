A Nintendo Entertainment System port followed. Players take control of the title character Jinborov Karnovski (ジンボロフ・カルノフスキー), or \"Karnov\" for short. Karnov is a strongman popularly illustrated as being from an unspecified part of the Soviet Union's Central Asian republics as shown on the arcade flyer and again in Karnov's Revenge.\r\n\r\nAs a character created by Data East, Karnov was reintroduced in several other games from the company, including Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja in which he is a boss in the first level. Karnov later appeared in the 1994 Neo-Geo game Karnov's Revenge. This game, also known as Fighter's History Dynamite, is not a sequel to the original Karnov, but to Fighter's History, a competitive one-on-one fighter in which Karnov is the final boss.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>卡洛夫</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32911\">Data East</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32911\">Data East</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Karnov</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人（交互）</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1987年1月</li>","collection":{"collect":2,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARCADE","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":32911,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/89/85/32911_prsn_IIwV7.jpg","name":"Data East","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":79465,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0a/1e/301318_a764A.jpg","title":"ファイターズヒストリーダイナマイト","type":"角色出演","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/79465"}]}
