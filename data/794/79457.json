The arcade game was also ported for the Nintendo Entertainment System, PC Engine (Japan-only), Sharp X68000 (Japan-only), and FM Towns (Japan-only) in 1990.\r\nImage Fight was released one year after Irem's successful horizontal scroller, R-Type, and, although not directly related, the two games have some similarities.\r\nThe player flies a futuristic red ship. R-Type Final identifies this ship as the OF-1 Daedalus, but it is not known if that was the ship's original name. However, the term OF-1 does appear in the NES version's instruction manual, as well as in the official artwork for the sequel, Image Fight II. The game appears to be set inside a holographic simulator, like the holodeck on Star Trek: The Next Generation.\r\nThe game begins with five stages taking place inside a combat simulation, and the player's ability to destroy enemy entities is tested. Upon finishing a simulation stage, the game displays results and shows if their score is considered passing or failing. The player must have an average kill rate of 90% or better in the simulation stages to immediately proceed to real combat. If the player fails, they must play an additional stage before entering real combat. Real combat consists of three stages. The real combat stages play very much like a traditional shoot em' up game, where the player immediately proceeds to the next stage upon completing the current stage.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>梦幻战机</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32197\">Irem</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32197\">Irem</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>IMAGEFIGHT</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Image Fight</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PCE</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>X68000</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>VC (Wii, Wii U)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>纵版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1988年11月</li>","collection":{"collect":2,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARCADE","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":32197,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ee/25/32197_prsn_E4Pv2.jpg","name":"Irem股份有限公司","desc":"开发"}]}
