It is a sequel to the 2009 video game Blood Bowl, based on the board game by Games Workshop. The game was developed for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and was released on 22 September 2015. A Mac OS X version of the game was launched in May 2016.\r\n\r\nThe game uses a new engine and removes the real-time mode found in the previous game, being turn-based only. It also introduces the Bretonnian as a new playable race, which was developed out of a fan-developed rulebook. The game features both a solo campaign and a multiplayer mode, with the solo campaign featuring the human team, the Reikland Reavers. Initially eight races are playable, but additional races were available as preorder bonus and downloadable content. A sequel, Blood Bowl 3 is scheduled to release in 2021.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/39335\">Cyanide</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32192\">Focus Home Interactive</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>怒火橄榄球2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Blood Bowl 2: Legendary Edition</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2015年9月22日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.bloodbowl-game.com/bloodbowl2/</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":39335,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/64/fd/39335_prsn_ye73l.jpg","name":"Cyanide","desc":"开发"},{"id":32192,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/21/02/32192_prsn_Xnnx6.jpg","name":"Focus Home Interactive","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":314107,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/aa/12/314107_UzkeT.jpg","title":"Blood Bowl","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/314107"}]}
