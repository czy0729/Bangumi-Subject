Hajime is enjoying some downtime after graduation before he is scheduled to start his training with a CAT company and enter the corporate world as a \"wage-slave\". One February afternoon you receive a flyer advertising a Virtual Reality Dating Simulator called May Club, apparently the most advanced human interface unit of this type to be developed. In May Club, you can supposedly act out any desire you wish with other May Club users, a world where \"virtually\" anything is possible and physically represented, and inhibitions are forgotten. Naturally, you're intrigued, and make it a point to spend your vacation time at May Club hoping to meet the woman of your dreams before starting your new life.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>VR Date - Gogatsu Club</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>May Club</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ADV</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995/8/25</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"cocktail","count":1},{"name":"ADV","count":1}]}
