It features a small flower-like protagonist named Zee Tee,[1] who is on a quest to rescue a princess named Nehema, collecting gems along the way, much in the plot-style of early Mario games. Each level consists of a set of parallel realities, each of which features different hazards, a unique artistic style, and a distinctive soundtrack. By using Zee Tee's ability to \"evert\" from one reality to another, the player can navigate him through obstacles to reach his goal.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超级小花</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platformer, Horror</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2008年12月29日</li><li><span>开发商: </span>Zaratustra Productions</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":18,"on_hold":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":7},{"name":"B站通关","count":4},{"name":"岚少实况","count":3},{"name":"ACT","count":3},{"name":"横版过关","count":2},{"name":"小游戏","count":2},{"name":"platformer","count":2},{"name":"视频通关","count":1},{"name":"实况通关","count":1},{"name":"STEAM","count":1},{"name":"独立游戏","count":1},{"name":"猎奇","count":1},{"name":"Platform","count":1}]}
