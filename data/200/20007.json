In class, Scott and Stiles see the real victim, deeply injured, from the bus attack. Worried, Scott turns to Derek for help on controlling his inner wolf. Derek agrees to help as long as Scott promises him an unknown favor.

Scott overhears Allison's dad and the woman, Allison's aunt Kate, saying Derek has 48 hours to live. The next day, Derek goes looking for Scott at his school and asks Jackson where he is. Jackson irritates him instead and Derek grabs the back of his neck, causing scratches from his wolf claws on Jackson's skin. After school, Stiles and Scott see Derek and he tells them he needs a wolfsbane bullet like the one the hunter used on him. Stiles is left with Derek while Scott goes to Allison's house to find the bullet. Scott is forced to stay for an awkward dinner while trying to find the bullet, and Stiles, having a hard time taking care of Derek, takes him to the vet's office. With Derek's health rapidly declining, Derek plans to have Stiles cut his arm off if they run out of time, since he will die if the wolfsbane reaches his heart. Scott finds a wolfsbane bullet in Kate's bag and takes one, making it to the vet's office right before Stiles starts cutting Derek's arm. Derek uses the wolfsbane in the bullet to supernaturally heal his wound. Scott admits the hunters of Allison's family seem like good people. To prove him wrong, Derek takes Scott to see his badly burned uncle, solemnly explaining that a fire killed his entire family 6 years ago, started by hunters who went against their own rules; it is hinted that Kate was one of those hunters.","status":"Air"},{"id":108721,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/108721","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"The Tell","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2011-06-27","comment":0,"desc":"Lydia and Jackson are outside a video store, trying to decide on a movie.
