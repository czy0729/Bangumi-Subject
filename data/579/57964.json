Using the motion-sensing Sixaxis controller, the player tilts a bathtub filled with water to move a rubber duck around the tub. The goal is to collect smaller ducks, which when obtained will follow one's large duck (much like the arcade game Flicky) and make it to the exit in a specified time. There are many pitfalls to avoid, such as jumping out of the tub and toy sharks which will try to eat the smaller ducks. Online Leaderboards track users fastest times, and allow users to see the replays of those fastest times. The game has three levels, fun, tricky, and tough. Each of these levels has 20 tubs that one needs to beaten to proceed to the next level.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超级橡皮鸭</li><li><span>别名: </span>鸭子</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人、多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2007年4月5日</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PS3","count":1}]}
