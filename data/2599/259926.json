It was created in Japan and translated for North American release by Working Designs in 1996, a translation that was also used by Sega in Europe under license from Working Designs. The game's main selling point was that battles involve up to 200 soldiers fighting on screen in real time, causing them to be often likened to the battle scenes in the then-recent film Braveheart. A sequel, later translated by fans, was released for the Saturn in Japan in 1998. The first game was re-released for the PlayStation 2 as part of the Sega Ages series.\r\nThe player assumes the role of one of eight rulers vying for control of Legendra. Each ruler has a set of generals under their command, and each general commands an army of up to 100 soldiers. Armies travel between towns and castles via fixed routes on an overhead scrolling map, much like the earlier Saturn game Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: Wall of Fire. When armies of different nations meet, they engage in battle.\r\nAlthough both the world map and battles unfold in real time, the game pauses when the player opens a menu.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>龙之力量</li><li><span>开发: </span>Jフォース、<a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Dragon Force</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>圣龙战记</li><li><span>平台: </span>SS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SRPG, RTS, RTT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996年3月29日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"SS","count":1},{"name":"SLG","count":1},{"name":"PS2","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":259928,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c7/ba/259928_UuS66.jpg","title":"ドラゴンフォースII -神去りし大地に-","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/259928"}]}
