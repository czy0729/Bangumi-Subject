The series chronicles the exploits and adventures of the title character and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The season was executive produced by series creator Hillenburg, who also acted as the showrunner.\r\n\r\nDuring the season's run, SpongeBob SquarePants became Nickelodeon's No. 2 children's program, behind Rugrats. Nearly 40 percent of SpongeBob's audience of 2.2 million were aged 18 to 34. The show signed a marketing deal with Target Corporation and Burger King, expanding its merchandising, and SpongeBob's popularity translated well into sales figures. In 2002, the show was nominated at the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Children's Program. Tom Kenny and Mary Jo Catlett were individually nominated at the 29th Annie Awards for their voice performances as SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff, respectively. Peter Straus and Paul Tibbitt were also nominated at the ceremony for their work on the \"Christmas Who?\" special. The episodes \"The Secret Box\" and \"Band Geeks\" won at the 2002 Golden Reel Awards for Best Sound Editing in Television—Animation, while the episodes \"Jellyfish Hunter\" and \"The Fry Cook Games\" received a nomination for Best Sound Editing in Television Animation—Music category.\r\n\r\nSeveral compilation DVDs that contained episodes from the season were released.
