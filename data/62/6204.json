Firestorm featured several new units and structures for both factions, and told a story where GDI and Nod were shown as being compelled to reluctantly join forces in order to overcome Nod\\'s renegade artificial intelligence, CABAL. Prior to the release of Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars in 2007, Firestorm\\'s storyline was unique in the Command & Conquer series as it was the first to feature ending sequences for the GDI and Nod factions which took place simultaneously, and both of which were considered as official canon storyline. By contrast, only the actions and events which occurred during the GDI campaigns were considered canon story throughout all other Command & Conquer games, with the events portrayed in the Brotherhood of Nod campaigns having traditionally been treated as alternate \\\"what if\\\" realities.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>命令与征服2：泰伯利亚之日：烈火风暴</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/17815\">Westwood Studios</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RTS</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2000-03-07</li>","collection":{"on_hold":0,"dropped":1,"wish":4,"collect":49,"doing":0},"tags":[{"name":"westwood","count":4},{"name":"RTS","count":3},{"name":"C&C","count":2},{"name":"EA","count":2},{"name":"经典","count":2},{"name":"2000","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1}],"crt":[{"id":208,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/09/1d/208_84fced301b442654dd8c23b3fc9_RA023.jpg","name":"Kane","desc":"配角"}],"staff":[{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"Electronic Arts","desc":"发行"},{"id":17815,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/de/72/17815_prsn_nPUiT.jpg","name":"Westwood Studios","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":567,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/99/c5/567_B4Zbf.jpg","title":"Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/567"},{"id":6203,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d4/b0/6203_7y5H3.jpg","title":"Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun","type":"主线故事","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/6203"}],"like":[{"id":6203,"name":"命令与征服2：泰伯利亚之日","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d4/b0/6203_7y5H3.jpg"},{"id":4181,"name":"战锤40K：战争黎明 II","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e2/54/4181_XxOPX.jpg"},{"id":6215,"name":"命令与征服：红色警戒3：起义时刻","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/91/3e/6215_yoB57.jpg"},{"id":6218,"name":"命令与征服：红色警戒2：尤里的复仇","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/02/f0/6218_DX7WZ.jpg"},{"id":6217,"name":"命令与征服：红色警戒2","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9d/18/6217_XCmdY.jpg"},{"id":6201,"name":"命令与征服3：凯恩之怒","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e0/cd/6201_DRij0.jpg"},{"id":1874,"name":"命令与征服：红色警戒","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/85/2c/6219_E72Ai.jpg"},{"id":10468,"name":"文明5","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/43/2f/10468_z3wWO.jpg"}]}
