The Behavioral Analysis Unit's most prominent agent is David Rossi (Joe Mantegna), a founding member of the BAU, who returns to help the team solve new cases, while pursuing some unfinished business of his own. The team is led by Special Agent Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson), a family man who is able to gain people's trust and unlock their secrets. Also on the team are Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster), the daughter of high-powered diplomats who recently joined the team and must prove her worth to Hotchner; Special Agent Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore), an expert on obsessional crimes; Special Agent Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler), a classically misunderstood genius whose social IQ is as low as his intellectual IQ is high; Jennifer \"JJ\" Jareau (A.J. Cook), a confident young agent who acts as the unit liaison for the team, and Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness), a computer wizard who helps research the cases. Each member brings his or her own area of expertise to the table as they pinpoint predators' motivations and identify their emotional triggers in the attempt to stop them.　","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>犯罪心理 第六季</li><li><span>配角: </span><a href=\"/person/47112\">Erin Matthews</a>、<a href=\"/person/44291\">Robert Knepper</a>、<a href=\"/person/43251\">Tim Curry</a></li><li><span>集数: </span>24</li><li><span>开始: </span>2010-09-22</li><li><span>类型: </span>犯罪 心理</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>首播国家: </span>美国</li><li><span>导演: </span>Charles Haid / Chris Long</li><li><span>主演: </span>Joe Mantegna / Thomas Gibson / Shemar Moore</li>","collection":{"on_hold":8,"dropped":6,"wish":18,"collect":125,"doing":22},"tags":[{"name":"美剧","count":43},{"name":"犯罪心理","count":22},{"name":"BAU","count":6},{"name":"CBS","count":3},{"name":"罪案","count":3},{"name":"2010","count":2},{"name":"犯罪","count":2},{"name":"推理","count":2},{"name":"心理","count":1},{"name":"ABC","count":1},{"name":"欧美","count":1},{"name":"悬疑","count":1},{"name":"","count":""}],"eps":[{"id":51762,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51762","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"The Longest Night","duration":"","airdate":"2010-09-22","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51763,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51763","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"JJ","duration":"","airdate":"2010-09-29","comment":1,"desc":""},{"id":51764,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51764","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Remembrance of Things Past","duration":"","airdate":"2010-10-06","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51765,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51765","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Compromising Positions","duration":"","airdate":"2010-10-13","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51766,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51766","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Safe Haven","duration":"","airdate":"2010-10-20","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51767,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51767","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Devil's Night","duration":"","airdate":"2010-10-27","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51768,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51768","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Middle Man","duration":"","airdate":"2010-11-03","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51769,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51769","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Reflection of Desire","duration":"","airdate":"2010-11-10","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51770,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51770","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Into the Woods","duration":"","airdate":"2010-11-17","comment":0,"desc":"The BAU is called to search for a man who is targeting children when an eight-year-old is found murdered on the Appalachian Trail."},{"id":51771,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51771","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"What Happens At Home","duration":"","airdate":"2010-12-08","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51772,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51772","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"25 to Life","duration":"","airdate":"2010-12-15","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51773,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51773","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Corazon","duration":"","airdate":"2011-01-19","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51774,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51774","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"The Thirteenth Step","duration":"","airdate":"2011-01-26","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51775,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51775","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"Sense Memory","duration":"","airdate":"2011-02-09","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51776,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51776","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"Today I Do","duration":"","airdate":"2011-02-16","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51777,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51777","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"Coda","duration":"","airdate":"2011-02-23","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51778,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51778","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"Valhalla","duration":"","airdate":"2011-03-02","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51779,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51779","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"Lauren","duration":"","airdate":"2011-03-16","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51780,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51780","type":0,"sort":19,"name":"With Friends Like These","duration":"","airdate":"2011-03-30","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51781,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51781","type":0,"sort":20,"name":"Hanley Waters","duration":"","airdate":"2011-04-06","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51782,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51782","type":0,"sort":21,"name":"The Stranger","duration":"","airdate":"2011-04-13","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51783,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51783","type":0,"sort":22,"name":"Out of the Light","duration":"","airdate":"2011-05-04","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":51784,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/51784","type":0,"sort":23,"name":"Big Sea","duration":"","airdate":"2011-05-11","comment":0,"desc":""},{"id":97935,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/97935","type":0,"sort":24,"name":"Supply &amp;
