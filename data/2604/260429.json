In this game, one or two players can select one of three fantasy warriors to fight through a large range of platform levels in order to defeat the forces of darkness.\r\nAt the beginning of the game, the player (or players) choose from one of three characters. From there, the player/s are thrown into the levels one at a time with a warning about the boss at the end of each one.\r\nThe player/s can collect items such as silver coins, potions and magic they could access in their inventory through the pause screen. While still in the pause screen, the players are able to get a better view of their surroundings by holding the C button and moving the screen around the player character with the directional pad. All of the levels are large enough to explore and many of them have secret areas that would award the player with additional pick-up items, such as potions of healing, invisibility, force fields, poison gas immunity, scrolls that increase player strength, keys, armor for additional attacks and strength per player, the Midas Ring which turns all enemies into bags of money and the Blast Wand which destroys all on-screen enemies.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>复仇之刃</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年</li><li><span>开发: </span>Beam Software</li>","collection":{"wish":1},"staff":[{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"艺电","desc":"发行"}]}
