In addition to vintage graphics for single player mode, an option for enhanced graphics is added. The game was released to the PlayStation Network as a PSone Classic on September 24, 2008 in Japan and December 10, 2009 in North America.\r\nBattle mode is added to this release, which features 8 courses with 3 levels per course.\r\nThe single player mode is very similar to the 1983 release of Bomberman. The player controls the titular Bomberman in a wide area, full of destructible and non-destructible blocks. The blocks can be destroyed with bombs, and may contain a power up that increases Bomberman's walking speed, the size of bomb explosions, the number of bombs able to be placed, or the ability to explode your bombs with the push of a button or to walk through walls or bombs. Some power ups are temporary, allowing Bomberman to be immune to bombs or monsters.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>炸弹人PS</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/17867\">ハドソン</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17867\">ハドソン</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Bomberman Party Edition</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>炸弹人派对版</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PSN</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1〜5人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1998年12月10日</li>","staff":[{"id":17867,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/c9/3b/17867_prsn_rFzfI.jpg","name":"ハドソン","desc":"开发"}]}
