There, they find her actions and vocabulary weird, specifically her use of the word nigger, referring to Brazil nuts as niggertoes. Louie decides he wants his daughters to talk to Ellen without any censoring, but the point becomes moot when she collapses and dies in her kitchen. Louie then does a stand-up bit about Tom Sawyer being a good kid and Huckleberry Finn a bigoted little jerk.","status":"Air"},{"id":461872,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/461872","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Subway/Pamela","name_cn":"","duration":"00:21:16","airdate":"2011-07-28","comment":1,"desc":"Louie starts his evening with a surreal trip on the NYC subway, where he witnesses a busker playing beautiful violin music while a filthy homeless man scrubs himself down with bottled water nearby, has a black-and-white vision of himself saving the riders from a soda-soaked seat, and then heads into the opening credits. Later, he meets his friend Pamela for lunch, and he ends up passionately telling her how he feels about her.

Then, at Ellen's request, he attends a CAM meeting, and goes out for drinks with her after. She invites him up to her suite, but Louie is denied when he tries to go in for a kiss. Ellen gives a long passionate speech about how nice it would be to talk, date a long time before a kiss (but not \"making out\"), then finally getting to see her in her underwear on their wedding night.

After seeing her enamored with Godfrey's set, Louie attempts, unsuccessfully, to impress his niece by doing crowd work. After the set, Louie is surprised to see Godfrey spark up a lively conversation with the usually sullen teen. When they arrive back at the apartment, Louie receives a call from a Philadelphia hospital informing him that Amy's mother was found \"acting irrationally\" in a public fountain and that she is being held under observation.

Louie is visibly uncomfortable and the husband, offended, throws Louie out. He calls his friend Chris Rock to pick him up, which he grudgingly does, and the two have a talk about Louie's lack of responsibility while Rock's wife ceaselessly insults Louie (off-camera).\r\n\r\nIn the second story, Louie takes Pamela to the airport. Pamela is going to Paris, where her ex-husband has been staying with her son. She reveals that she intends to stay indefinitely, and begs Louie to move on and stop holding out hope that they could be together. Louie watches her as she walks off toward her terminal. When she is about to step out of view, she turns, waves, and shouts \"Wave to me!\" which Louie mishears as \"Wait for me.\" The comedian shouts back, \"I will wait for you!\" and exits the airport with a smile.","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":107343,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/59/8c/107343_VrZ3T.jpg","title":"Louie Season 1","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/107343"},{"id":128188,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4b/8a/128188_866Fp.jpg","title":"Louie Season 3","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/128188"}]}
