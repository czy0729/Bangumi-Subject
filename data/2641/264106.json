It stars a cast of robot characters introduced in The Playroom, where they appeared as robots that lived inside of the DualShock 4 controller. The player teams up with Captain Astro and goes on a quest to rescue his lost crew scattered across 5 worlds and 20 levels. In total, there are 212 Bots to rescue. In a VR space, the player uses their body to lean and see past obstacles or headbutt parts of the scenery. The DualShock 4 controller is used to control Astro, but exists within the VR space as a virtual gadget to help Astro on his way. The game counts 20 stages, 6 bosses, 26 challenge stages, and a collection room on board the Astro Ship.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>宇宙机器人:搜救行动</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/39356\">SIEジャパンスタジオ</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1018\">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ASTRO BOT: RESCUE MISSION</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS4 (PSVR)</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>VR, Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2018-10-02</li><li><span>售价: </span>39.99 USD</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.jp.playstation.com/games/astro-bot/</li>","collection":{"wish":7,"collect":10,"doing":2},"tags":[{"name":"PS4","count":8},{"name":"VR","count":6},{"name":"ACT","count":2},{"name":"2018","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":39356,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/49/64/39356_prsn_GqRPJ.jpg","name":"索尼互动娱乐日本工作室","desc":"开发"},{"id":1018,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/37/28/1018_prsn_Yvv5n.jpg","name":"索尼互动娱乐","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":273491,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/82/b7/273491_y8hA9.jpg","title":"ASTRO BOT: RESCUE MISSION Soundtrack","type":"原声集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/273491"},{"id":308562,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/1b/a0/308562_wPpQk.jpg","title":"Astro's Playroom","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/308562"}]}
