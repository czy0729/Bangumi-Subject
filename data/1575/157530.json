The core of the gameplay is to explore in order to see how different is each point of view. The player will switch from one character to another trying to correctly and fully interact with all the environment. Missing an interaction or trying to interact with the wrong elements will determine \"loss\" in the game, causing the game to restart from the beginning.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>人生之路</li><li><span>平台: </span>Mac OS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>模拟游戏</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2014年12月30日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://thewayoflife.it/</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"STEAM","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1}]}
