So great, he escaped Granny Goodness' gruesome orphanage and the dangers of Apokolips to travel across galaxies and set up a new life on Earth with his wife, Big Barda. Using the stage alter ego of Mister Miracle, he has made quite a career for himself showing off his acrobatic escape techniques. He even caught the attention of the Justice League, who has counted him among its ranks.\r\n\r\nYou might say Scott Free has everything--so why isn't it enough? Mister Miracle has mastered every illusion, achieved every stunt, pulled off every trick--except one. He has never escaped death. Is it even possible? Our hero is going to have to kill himself if he wants to find out.\r\n\r\nFrom Hugo Award nominated writer Tom King and artist Mitch Gerads, the team behind The Sheriff of Babylon, comes an ambitious new take on one of Jack Kirby's most beloved New Gods in Mister Miracle! One of the best-reviewed series of the year and already a classic in the making!
