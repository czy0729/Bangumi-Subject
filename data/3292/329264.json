The battle royale game will feature the kind of gunplay you’d expect from a multiplayer shooter, but The First Soldier ups the ante with magic spells, Final Fantasy summons, and Chocobos on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nAccording to the first teaser trailer for Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier, the Shinra Electric Company is looking to bolster its military forces and develops the Soldier program — then apparently puts them to the test in a big multiplayer fray, which is where The First Soldier comes in. The battle royale game is set before the events of Final Fantasy 7, Square Enix said in a news release.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/497\">スクウェア・エニックス</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/497\">スクウェア・エニックス</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Battle Royale</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2021年</li><li><span>售价: </span>免费游玩，含内购</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.jp.square-enix.com/ffvii_fs/</li>","staff":[{"id":497,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/e6/d9/497_prsn_z3Upo.jpg","name":"史克威尔·艾尼克斯","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":1259,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/68/a8/1259_RrJXb.jpg","title":"ファイナルファンタジーVII","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/1259"}]}
