So he heads back to the beginning, to the laboratory where Ultron created him and molded him into a weapon. The place where he first rebelled against his given destiny and imagined that he could be more -that he could be a man. There, he builds them. A wife, Virginia. Two teenage twins, Viv and Vin. They look like him. They have his powers. They share his grandest ambition -or is that obsession? -the unrelenting need to be ordinary. Behold the Visions! COLLECTING: VISION 1-6\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time a robot and a witch fell in love. What followed was a tale of the dead and the dying, of the hopeful and the lost, of the wronged and the avenged. And in the end, after both had fallen, the witch and the robot rose from their dirt and eyed each other across a field of blood and bone. Forty-five years in the making, this is the story of Scarlet Witch and the Vision. Before family, there was love. And war.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING: VISION 7-12","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>幻视</li><li><span>册数: </span>2</li><li><span>话数: </span>12</li><li><span>出版社: </span>Marvel</li><li><span>作者: </span>Tom King</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
