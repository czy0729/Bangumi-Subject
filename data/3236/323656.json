Players, after selecting a car and track, attempt to beat the other races (computer-controlled, or other online players). Dangerous Driving includes the same crash elements from Burnout; players can ram opponents into the sides of the track or oncoming damage to cause them to crash (known as Takedowns), temporarily stopping them from racing before their car respawns and they can continue on. By performing Takedowns or other driving stunts like drifting, they build up a Nitro meter; once past a certain threshold they can activate Nitro which gives them a speed boost while some part of the meter is filled.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>危险驾驶</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RAC</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019年4月9日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Three Fields Entertainment</li><li><span>发行: </span>‪Three Fields Entertainment</li>"}
