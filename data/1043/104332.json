S.H.I.E.L.D. traces Donnie to a Hydra ship where he has killed a number of Hydra agents, but meanwhile, Hydra sends Simmons with a team to find Donnie themselves, as a test of her loyalty. Growing suspicious of the others, Fitz accidentally discovers Ward's cell, and while depriving him of oxygen as a demonstration of what he suffered, Ward confesses to him that Donnie actually already was a Hydra asset, and that the mission was really to reactivate his brainwashing. On the ship, May - who knows of Simmons' mission - shoots around her and Donnie, but allows them to escape to maintain Simmons' cover. Donnie is cornered by Hydra and re-brainwashed, but before he can leave with them, Skye shoots him with a sniper rifle. He falls into the water and freezes, but government forces are unable to locate his body. Coulson informs Fitz of Simmons' mission, while Whitehall decides to promote her despite their failure to retrieve Donnie.
