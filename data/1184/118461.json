The Office is an American adaptation of the British TV series of the same name, and is presented in a mockumentary format, portraying the daily lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.\r\n\r\nThis season introduced the main characters, and established the general plot, which revolves around Michael Scott (Steve Carell), regional manager of the Scranton branch office, trying to convince the filmmakers of the documentary that he presides over a happy, well-running office. Meanwhile, sales rep Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) finds methods to undermine his cube-mate, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson); receptionist Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) tries to deal with Michael's insensitivities and flubs; and temporary employee Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) is acting mostly as an observer of the insanity around him.\r\n\r\nSeason one of The Office aired on Tuesdays in the United States at 9:30 p.m. The season debuted to high numbers, and garnered moderately positive reviews from critics aside from a poorly received pilot episode. While some enjoyed the pilot, others opined that it was a mere copy of the original British version. Universal Studios Home Entertainment released season one in a single DVD on August 16, 2005. The DVD contained all six episodes, as well as commentaries from creators, writers, actors, and directors on most of the episodes, as well as deleted scenes from all of the episodes.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>办公室 第一季</li><li><span>集数: </span>6</li><li><span>开始: </span>2005年3月24日</li><li><span>结束: </span>2005年4月26日</li><li><span>类型: </span>Sitcom Mockumentary</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>USA</li><li><span>电视台: </span>NBC</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0386676</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":8},"tags":[{"name":"美剧","count":2},{"name":"NBC","count":2},{"name":"喜剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":449041,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449041","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449042,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449042","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449043,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449043","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449044,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449044","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449045,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449045","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449046,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449046","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":118462,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/bc/18/118462_hXY9p.jpg","title":"The Office (Season 2)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/118462"}]}
