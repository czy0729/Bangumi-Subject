In his absence, Erin strikes up a romance with new customer service rep Pete, who along with Clark, another new character, replaces Kelly, who left for Ohio with her new husband (Ryan also moves to Ohio for \"unrelated reasons\"). Meanwhile, Jim receives an exciting opportunity from an old college friend, who offers him a job at Athlead, a sports marketing company based in Philadelphia. Darryl also jumps on board, but the distance and dedication to Athlead hurts Jim's relationship with Pam. Angela also must deal with her husband's infidelity with Oscar. She also deals with her lingering attraction to Dwight, who inherits his family's beet farm. Dwight receives more good news when David Wallace handpicks him to be the new manager after Andy quits to pursue an acting career, which quickly ends when he embarrasses himself at an a cappella singing competition that turns into a viral web sensation. Dwight later makes Jim his Assistant to the Regional Manager and the two officially end their grudge. After Jim reconciles with Pam, choosing to stay in Scranton over Philadelphia, Dwight professes his love for Angela, and finally marries her. In the series finale, taking place one year after the release of the documentary, the employees reunite for Dwight and Angela's wedding, for which Michael returns (with help from Jim who was the person Dwight first asked to be his best man) to serve as the best man. Kelly and Ryan run away together, Nellie now lives in Poland and \"adopts\" Ryan's abandoned baby, Erin meets her birth parents, Andy gets a job at Cornell, Stanley retires to Florida, Kevin and Toby are both fired with the former buying a bar and the latter moving to New York City to become an author, Oscar runs for State Senate, Jim and Pam, at her persuasion, move to Austin to open a new branch of Athleap (previously Athlead) with Darryl (Dwight \"fires\" them to give them both severance packages), and Creed is arrested for his many crimes.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>办公室 第九季</li><li><span>集数: </span>25</li><li><span>开始: </span>2012年9月20日</li><li><span>结束: </span>2013年5月16日</li><li><span>类型: </span>Sitcom Mockumentary</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>USA</li><li><span>语言: </span>English</li><li><span>电视台: </span>NBC</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0386676</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"美剧","count":2},{"name":"喜剧","count":2},{"name":"NBC","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":449239,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449239","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449240,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449240","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449241,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449241","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449242,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449242","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449243,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449243","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449244,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449244","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449245,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449245","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449246,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449246","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449247,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449247","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449248,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449248","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449249,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449249","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449250,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449250","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449251,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449251","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449252,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449252","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449253,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449253","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449254,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449254","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449255,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449255","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449256,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449256","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449257,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449257","type":0,"sort":19,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449258,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449258","type":0,"sort":20,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449259,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449259","type":0,"sort":21,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449260,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449260","type":0,"sort":22,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449261,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449261","type":0,"sort":23,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449262,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449262","type":0,"sort":24,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449263,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449263","type":0,"sort":25,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":118469,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/80/15/118469_WY1Bp.jpg","title":"The Office (Season 8)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/118469"}]}
