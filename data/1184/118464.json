{"id":118464,"type":6,"name":"The Office (Season 4)","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/22/60/118464_A44Cn.jpg","rating":{"total":1,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":1,"9":0,"10":0},"score":8},"summary":"NBC ordered a full fourth season of 30 half-hour episodes, but ended with only 19 due to a halt in production caused by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. The season consists of 9 half-hour episodes, and 5 hour-long episodes to comprise the 19 total episodes of material created.\r\n\r\nKaren has left the Scranton branch after her breakup with Jim, and becomes regional manager at the Utica branch. Pam and Jim date happily. An unemployed Jan moves in with Michael, until the dissolution of their relationship midway through the season. After Dwight's crude (though well-intentioned) method of euthanasia of Angela's ailing cat without her permission, she leaves him for Andy, leading Dwight into depression. Ryan, in his new corporate life in New York City, attempts to modernize Dunder Mifflin with a new website for online sales; he also learns that his boss, David Wallace, favors Jim, and thus Ryan attempts to sabotage Jim's career. Ryan is soon arrested and fired for committing fraud related to the website's sales numbers. Toby, embarrassed after accidentally revealing an affection for Pam, announces he is moving to Costa Rica, and is replaced by Holly Flax, who quickly shows fondness towards Michael. Pam decides to follow her artistic interests and attend a three-month graphic design course at the Pratt Institute in New York City. In the season finale Andy proposes to Angela, who reluctantly agrees. Phyllis then catches Dwight and Angela having sex in the office.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>办公室 第四季</li><li><span>集数: </span>19</li><li><span>开始: </span>2007年9月27日</li><li><span>结束: </span>2008年5月15日</li><li><span>类型: </span>Sitcom Mockumentary</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>USA</li><li><span>语言: </span>English</li><li><span>电视台: </span>NBC</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0386676</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"美剧","count":2},{"name":"喜剧","count":2},{"name":"NBC","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":449094,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449094","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449095,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449095","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449096,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449096","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449097,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449097","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449098,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449098","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449099,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449099","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449100,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449100","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449101,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449101","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449102,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449102","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449103,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449103","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449104,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449104","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449105,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449105","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449106,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449106","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449107,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449107","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449108,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449108","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449109,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449109","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449110,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449110","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449111,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449111","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":449112,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/449112","type":0,"sort":19,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":118463,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/40/a6/118463_J1Nxx.jpg","title":"The Office (Season 3)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/118463"},{"id":118465,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f8/7e/118465_D8oAi.jpg","title":"The Office (Season 5)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/118465"}]}
