The game was released through the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in North America, Europe, and Australia from April to May 2012, and later received a Japanese release by CyberFront for the PlayStation Network in February 2013. A Microsoft Windows version, developed by Lab Zero Games and co-published by Autumn Games and Marvelous, was released in August 2013. A Japanese arcade version, produced by M2 for the NESiCAxLive service, was released in 2015. A mobile spinoff of the game, developed by Hidden Variable Studios and published by Line, was released for Android and iOS devices in May 2017.\r\nIn Skullgirls, players engage in combat against one another, with teams of one, two, or three characters attempting to knock out their opponents or have the most cumulative health when time runs out. The setting of the game revolves around the \"Skull Heart\", an artifact which grants wishes for women. If a wisher with an impure soul uses the Skull Heart, she is transformed into the next \"Skullgirl\", a monster bent on destruction. Skullgirls received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the animation and gameplay mechanics, while criticizing its limited roster size and online multiplayer features.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>骷髅少女</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/20629\">Lab Zero Games</a></li><li><span>原画: </span><a href=\"/person/12516\">Bahi JD</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>骷髅女孩</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>スカルガールズ</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS Vita</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Arcade</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2012年04月10日</li>","collection":{"on_hold":9,"dropped":6,"wish":22,"collect":69,"doing":7},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":18},{"name":"FTG","count":18},{"name":"ACT","count":7},{"name":"STEAM","count":7},{"name":"手柄","count":4},{"name":"本地多人","count":3},{"name":"PS3","count":3},{"name":"格斗","count":3},{"name":"普通游戏","count":1},{"name":"已购","count":1},{"name":"LabZeroGames","count":1},{"name":"分屏游玩","count":1},{"name":"日系","count":1},{"name":"PSV","count":1},{"name":"独立游戏","count":1},{"name":"2012","count":1},{"name":"画面精细","count":1},{"name":"PS4","count":1},{"name":"赞！","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":20629,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/d0/fd/20629_prsn_dUOOg.jpg","name":"Lab Zero Games","desc":"开发"},{"id":12516,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/35/12516_prsn_mUmLM.jpg","name":"Bahi JD","desc":"原画"}],"relations":[{"id":280886,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/2a/94/280886_5w02p.jpg","title":"Skullgirls Mobile","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/280886"},{"id":135480,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f1/61/135480_wz20F.jpg","title":"Skullgirls Encore","type":"资料片、外传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/135480"},{"id":229692,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/75/c6/229692_CYCfo.jpg","title":"Skullgirls 2nd Encore","type":"资料片、外传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/229692"}]}
