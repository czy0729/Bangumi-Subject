After fighting several thugs and corrupt cops working for HR, the trio breaks into the city morgue. Meanwhile, Fusco is captured by HR while relaying information to Carter; he is subsequently tortured by Simmons and an accomplice, Detective William Petersen (Lee Tergesen), who now have the key to Carter's safe deposit box, but do not know the location. After refusing to give the location of the safe deposit box containing damning evidence against HR, Simmons sends one of his men Lin (Khalil Kain) to kill Fusco's son Lee (Sean McCarthy). Shaw, anticipating that move, breaks into Fusco's house and kills Lin, saving Lee. Eventually, Fusco frees himself by breaking his own thumb to get free of the handcuffs and kills Petersen. Holed up in the morgue, Reese and Carter bond and he surprisingly shows his true feelings for her by kissing her. Suddenly, a group of HR cops infiltrates the morgue and shut off the power.

Shaw is able to foil the plan but is confronted by Kelli, whose boss Cyril (Gene Farber) is an extortionist revealed to be forcing Kelli to commit robberies while her daughter is kept kidnapped. The team learns that the Bible is being kept in a heavily guarded building belonging to a company called Symmetric Security.

The Machine also provides Grace's number as a result, and Reese, Shaw and Root work to protect her while evading Decima, who use Samaritan to spy on them within the range of New York. Grace is eventually kidnapped and interviewed by Greer, who reveals his extensive knowledge of her and begins asking about her life with Finch. When he implies that Finch lied to her, Grace snaps and firmly tells Greer that Finch would never lie as Grace gave him her unbreakable trust. When the team manages to locate Decima's current HQ, Greer takes Grace and tells Reese and Shaw that they can get Grace back in exchange for giving them Finch. Finch agrees to the deal, and at Jefferson Bridge, Grace is blindfolded and brought to Reese and crew while Finch is taken by Decima. Reese later gives Grace an envelope, saying that she has been accepted for a job in Italy. Greer, meanwhile, finally meets Finch in person and sits down with him to talk.\r\n\r\nDirected by Frederick E. O.

His brother had been falsely accused of terrorist activities, held without trial, and had committed suicide as a result. The Machine's latest numbers include Control, Senator Garrison, a presidential assistant, and a seemingly unconcerned Greer. Vigilance kidnaps them, along with Finch, and the episode ends with Vigilance about to conduct a private trial of their detainees, while Reese and Shaw, along with Hersh (joining forces after a tense confrontation) watch from a closed-circuit TV screen set up for their benefit.

Flashbacks show he was recruited by Vigilance. Reese and Hersh search for the trial venue. Root and Shaw smuggle servers into the Samaritan array. Fusco deals with a diversion. The presidential assistant is put on the stand and becomes defiant; Collier kills him. The Senator refuses to name his superior, but inadvertently reveals that he reports to Control; he is spared. Control refuses to confirm or deny anything. Collier is about to kill her when Finch confesses he is the author of The Machine. With a Vigilance command post now compromised, Collier takes Finch, Greer, Control and the senator to a nearby rooftop. Collier is wounded in a gunfight. Greer tells Collier that he and his Decima team created Vigilance as a \"devil\" for Samaritan to justify itself, and that he himself recruited Collier. Meanwhile, Hersh has been wounded in a gunfight in the trial building. He finds a booby-trapped bomb but cannot disengage it before it explodes, killing him, several police officers and anyone left inside the building. Greer's lieutenant kills Collier, and is about to kill Finch when Reese arrives and wounds the gunman. In this gunfight, Harold gets a shoulder wound but takes cover. Greer and his gunman flee. Finch and Reese leave once the carnage is over. The principals regroup, but Samaritan is being brought online. Root advises the team to abandon their library home and assume new identities. The code in the servers she and Shaw installed will report the team dead and hide information about their new identities. As Shaw, Root, Reese and Finch head off in different directions and the remaining Vigilance team members are killed on the streets, the now fully operational Samaritan asks Greer for commands. Greer instead asks Samaritan what commands it has for his team. The episode ends with the Samaritan screen displaying, \"Calculating response.\"\r\n\r\nDirected by Chris Fisher\r\nWritten by Greg Plageman & David Slack"}],"crt":[{"id":7104,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/cd/c9/7104_crt_v8YT1.jpg","name":"Central Intelligence Agency","desc":"客串"}],"staff":[{"id":25434,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/98/91/25434_prsn_wVKt4.jpg","name":"Jim Caviezel","desc":"主演"},{"id":5758,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5f/07/5758_prsn_N3zG3.jpg","name":"J.J.Abrams","desc":"制片人/制作人"},{"id":40005,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/7d/eb/40005_prsn_8dP3f.jpg","name":"Steven Ogg","desc":"配角"},{"id":29059,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/cc/6f/29059_prsn_4QZjv.jpg","name":"Ramin Djawadi","desc":"音乐"}],"relations":[{"id":52779,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c5/9a/52779_MV1d7.jpg","title":"Person of Interest (Season 2)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/52779"},{"id":107009,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/42/ed/107009_EDri3.jpg","title":"Person of Interest (Season 4)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/107009"}]}
