This science fiction video game was originally developed by Toys for Bob (Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III) and published by Accolade in 1992 for MS-DOS. In 1994, it was ported to the 3DO by Crystal Dynamics with an enhanced multimedia presentation, allowed by CD technology. The source code of the 3DO port was licensed under the GNU GPL in 2002, which put the game content under a Creative Commons license. A project called \"The Ur-Quan Masters\" re-made the game. \r\n\r\nReleased to critical acclaim, Star Control II features exoplanet abundant star systems, hyperspace travel, extraterrestrial life, and interstellar diplomacy. Over 25 unique alien races exist for the player to interact with.
