With each egg Sheepo collects, you then gain the ability to transform into that creature on contact, and explore the deeper reaches of the planets sprawling environment\r\nSheepo is a metroidvania, but contains no standard combat. Instead, gameplay is based on platforming and exploration. With the collection of each creature, Sheepo is able to dig, fly, and teleport across an interconnected series of landscapes, uncovering hidden shrines, old ruins, and strange characters.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platformer</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2020年8月27日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Kyle Thompson</li><li><span>发行: </span>Kyle Thompson</li>","collection":{"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":1}]}
