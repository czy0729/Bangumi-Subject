Outside of the prison on the day of Daniels' release, a state senator (Roland Foulkes) says the government will continue to pursue its case against Daniel as the DNA evidence is a technicality and should not absolve Daniel from being tried for the crime. Before becoming a state senator Roland was the prosecutor in Daniel's trial. Roland meets later with a group of local officials, including former Sherriff CJ Pickens and current Sherriff Carl Daggett, and tells them to track down the primary witnesses from the Daniel Holden rape and murder case and that Daniels' release as a result of the DNA test does not mean that Daniel is innocent. The senator reveals that Daniel confessed to the rape and murder, and was found putting flowers on his girlfriend's dead body. Amantha drives Daniel around town to show him what changed. Daniel falls asleep. Sherriff Carl Daggett trails Amantha's car in his police cruiser and eventually stops. Two of these witnesses, George Melton and Trey Willis, meet by a creek in the woods. Trey tells George to tell the truth, and George asks Trey what is the truth. After Trey leaves George shoots himself in the head.","status":"Air"},{"id":264943,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/264943","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Sexual Peeling","name_cn":"","duration":"00:44:44","airdate":"2013-04-22","comment":0,"desc":"Daniel goes down and says hi to his mom, Janet, and asks if he can have a beer.
