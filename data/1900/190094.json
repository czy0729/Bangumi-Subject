The game puts you in the role of Evan Winter, a young professional in Toronto, as he moves through three distinct periods of his life.\r\n\r\nThe story is linear, unavoidable and (hopefully) thought-provoking. You experience his perceptions, fall under the consequences of his decisions, and meet everyone who didn’t change him. Gameplay is minimal, and serves only to move from one part of the (admittedly) text-heavy story to the next. The game fiercely attempts to be worth it.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>真实阳光</li><li><span>平台: </span>Android</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PSV</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>文字AVG</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>RPG Maker VX ACE</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.actualsunlight.com/</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":11,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"PSV","count":5},{"name":"AVG","count":2},{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"通关","count":1}]}
