The Powerpuff Girls warn Princess Morbucks that she will not get any thing but coal in her stocking if she does not check her attitude. Princess, after evaluating their opinion and every close to her, she hatches a devious plan by going to the North Pole and switches the nice list with the naughty list (which only had her name on it), thereby making every other kid in Townsville seem naughty, while she looked nice, thereby allowing her to get what she wants: to be a Powerpuff Girl. Meanwhile, The Powerpuff Girls decorate their house in a race for who puts the star on the tree, which Blossom wins. Later on that night, Bubbles hears reindeer on the roof, indicating Santa’s arrival at their house, she tries to wake her sisters but to no avail. Bubbles tip toes downstairs and looks at their tries with no presents around it, then when she looks at her stocking and then Blossom and Bubbles stockings, there was coal. Bubbles is shocked by this, since saving the day is their daily responsibility, why would they get coal. Bubbles then decides to investigate by going to the neighboring houses to find nothing under their tree and uses her X-ray vision to find coal in their stocking. Bubbles returns home to tell her sisters about the false presents and they believe Santa made a mistake and that they must head to the north pole to tell Santa that he didn't check his list twice and save Christmas. Before the girls leave home, they are greeted by Princess Morbucks, who has gotten her present, which is being a Powerpuff Girl. The girls are shocked to believe that Santa would think that Princess is nice. The girls now make it a mission to right this wrong, but Princess tells them that they will have to beat her to the North Pole before they can tell Santa what she did or she will tell him a lie that they are coming to destroy the workshop to get revenge for getting coal. The race is on to get to the North Pole but the PPGs are on a poor start because Princess uses weapons like her superpowers, trees, and ice to get ahead of them but falls victim to their powers as well. The girls make it to the North Pole and destroy the workshop while fighting and they end up in Santa’s office. An angry Santa takes his anger out on them after delivering coal all night and the girls try to approach him on the mistake he make but gets rebuffed with his super long “naughty” list. Santa then realizes who the girls are and acknowledges their heroism, which infuriates Princess, who says that since she is better than everyone then she should get whatever she wants for Christmas and is very rude to Santa. Santa responds by pointing out Princess’ demonic attitude and puts her on the Permanent Naughty Plaque, making her naughty for the rest of her life. Upset, she threatens to tell her father, but before she can fly home, Santa strips her of her powers. Santa tries to formulate a plan to get the nice kids presents, but with his workshop destroyed, he asks the PPGs to deliver the presents. The girls accept the task and at lightning speed, deliver the presents to children all over the world and return home exhausted. The Professor tries to wake them up and tells them that Santa came and that there is presents downstairs. The girls decline saying that they are tired but change their mind and rush downstairs to open their presents with The Professor.","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":177696,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/32/5d/177696_Q26NH.jpg","title":"The Powerpuff Girls (Season 5)","type":"主线故事","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/177696"}]}
