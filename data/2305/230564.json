Iconoclastic in his cartooning and page layouts, subtle in his plotting, and deft in his capturing of the human experience, Evens has crafted a tangled, dark masterwork.\r\n\r\nChristine lives in a big house with her father and her cat, Lucy. When Lucy gets sick and dies, Christine is devastated. But alone in her room, something special happens: a panther pops out of her dresser drawer and begins to tell her stories of distant Pantherland, where he is the crown prince.\r\n\r\nA shape-shifter who tells Christine anything she wants to hear, Panther begins taking over Christine's life, alienating her from her other toys and friends. As Christine's world spirals out of control, so does the world Panther has created for her. Panther is a chilling voyage into the shadowy corners of the human psyche. The Drawn & Quarterly edition of Panther is an extended \"director's cut,\" featuring additional material not included in the original book.","info":"<li><span>出版社: </span>Drawn and Quarterly</li><li><span>价格: </span>$26.95</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2016-04-26</li><li><span>页数: </span>120</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>1770462260</li><li><span>作者: </span>Brecht Evens</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"Brecht_Evens","count":1},{"name":"欧美漫","count":1}]}
