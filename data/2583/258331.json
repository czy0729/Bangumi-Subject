Initially released in Japan in August 1996, the game was later made available in North America in July 1997 by Working Designs. It is the first Albert Odyssey title to be released in English, as well as the first to feature traditional turn-based role-playing elements as opposed to tactical, strategy-based gameplay. Legend of Eldean was created as a \"gaiden\", or sidestory to the original titles, and contains back story, characters, and plot that are independent from earlier games in the series. The North American version received generally favorable reviews.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>亚鲁巴战记外传～艾尔丹传奇～</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/17913\">Sunsoft</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17913\">Sunsoft</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/32929\">小高直樹</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>英雄圣战外传</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Albert Odyssey: Legend of Eldean</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Albert Odyssey Gaiden ~Legend of Eldean~</li><li><span>平台: </span>SS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996年8月9日</li>","staff":[{"id":17913,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/3c/00/17913_prsn_tGoT3.jpg","name":"Sunsoft","desc":"开发"},{"id":32929,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/d3/e0/32929_prsn_qSqC0.jpg","name":"小高直树","desc":"音乐"}]}
