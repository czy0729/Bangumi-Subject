It is the latest installment in the Gradius series, and was released in Japan on September 2, 2008, and in North America on March 9, 2009, and in the PAL regions on July 3, 2009.\r\nGradius ReBirth is a side-scrolling 2D shooter much like previous Gradius games, and has been described as a \"remix\" of levels from past games rather than an entirely new game. The game features two modes: a standard game with unlimited credits and a Score Attack mode where players are only given a single credit to beat the game. Score Attack also supports online leaderboards.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>宇宙巡航机 重生</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/39584\">M2</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>GRADIUS ReBirth</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>グラディウス ReBirth</li><li><span>平台: </span>Wii</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>横版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2008年9月2日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":39584,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/64/74/39584_prsn_8FmpP.jpg","name":"M2","desc":"开发"},{"id":747,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/c1/747_prsn_43cah.jpg","name":"科乐美","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":108975,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c5/79/108975_jHHWe.jpg","title":"GRADIUS V","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/108975"}]}
