The game was originally developed by Face but was never released and they went bankrupt; SNK acquired the game's prototype and finished and released it.\r\nThe game's ending labels Zupapa! as Episode 1, implying that there were possible plans for a sequel.\r\nZupapa! is a single screen platformer similar to Bubble Bobble. the objective is to defeat all enemies on the screen in order to move to the next one. You control Zupapa, which can punch enemies to stun them, after which you can move over them to defeat them. In each stage you can capture the Zooks, which are little sidekicks that Zupapa can throw at the enemies to stun them, so that when they are defeated they'll generate a star circle which will automatically kill any enemy which touches it. The more Zooks you throw at a single enemy, the larger will be the circle radius. Any enemy defeated by the circle will drop a fruit which adds to the score. The player will also finds power-ups which enhances Zupapa's power, speed and jumping ability.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>星星大战</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/705\">SNK</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/705\">SNK</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Zupapa!</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>星星大作战</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT (单屏动作)</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2001年9月</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARC","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":705,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a5/82/705_prsn_o7m1w.jpg","name":"SNK","desc":"开发"}]}
