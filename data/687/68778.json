As a shadowy third party, your goal is to goad both factions into mutually assured destruction, thus paving the way for your own nefarious scheme. It’s a simple RTS in which you play both sides, trying to keep the battle alive — but nobody victorious — long enough for both factions’ nuclear arsenals to come online.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>致命失败</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RTS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2010年</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.third-helix.com/games-section/fail-deadly/</li><li><span>开发: </span>Josh Sutphin</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"indie","count":1}]}
