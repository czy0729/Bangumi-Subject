{"id":86280,"type":3,"name":"Rhythm of the Pride Lands: Music Inspired by Disney's The Lion King","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ae/92/86280_H8pNb.jpg","summary":"Rhythm of the Pride Lands is an audio CD released on February 28, 1995 by Walt Disney Records, a \"sequel\" to the original motion picture soundtrack of the animated film The Lion King. The CD, was originally an independent project developed by Jay Rifkin and Lebo M and included songs and performances inspired by, but not featured in the film. As the project developed Disney came on board and supported the project. Most of the tracks were composed by African composer Lebo M and producer Jay Rifkin and focused primarily on the African influences of the film's original music, with most songs being sung either partially or entirely in various African languages. Several songs featured in the album would later have incarnations in other The Lion King-oriented projects, inspiring Julie Taymor's stage musical or the direct-to-video sequels, such as \"He Lives in You\". As of April 1997, the album had sold more than 900,000 copies and by October 1998 was certified platinum.\r\n\"Warthog Rhapsody\", which delved deeper into the origins of Pumbaa than \"Hakuna Matata\" did, was originally recorded to be included in the movie, but was cut out during storyboard and never animated. The song was later reworked with new lyrics into the song \"That's All I Need\" for The Lion King 1½.\r\nRhythm of the Pride Lands was initially printed in a very limited quantity. Today it is available digitally through the iTunes Store.","info":"<li><span>厂牌: </span><a href=\"/person/12738\">Walt Disney Records</a></li><li><span>录音: </span><a href=\"/person/12738\">Walt Disney Records</a></li><li><span>版本特性: </span>Soundtrack</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>1995-02-28</li><li><span>价格: </span>$9.98</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>47:38</li><li><span>碟片数量: </span>1</li><li><span>艺术家: </span>Various Artists</li><li><span>发行商: </span>Walt Disney Records</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 He Lives In You","href":"/ep/332743"},{"title":"2 Hakuna Matata - Jimmy Cliff","href":"/ep/332744"},{"title":"3 The Lion Sleeps Tonight","href":"/ep/332745"},{"title":"4 Kube","href":"/ep/332746"},{"title":"5 Lea Halalela - Khululiwe Sithole","href":"/ep/332747"},{"title":"6 It's Time","href":"/ep/332748"},{"title":"7 One By One","href":"/ep/332749"},{"title":"8 Warhog Rhapsody - Nathan Lane And Ernie Sabella/Maxi Anderson/Ron Kunene/Nandi M","href":"/ep/332750"},{"title":"9 Lala","href":"/ep/332751"},{"title":"10 Busa","href":"/ep/332752"},{"title":"11 Noyana","href":"/ep/332753"}]}],"staff":[{"id":12738,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/4d/19/12738_prsn_6kS6O.jpg","name":"Walt Disney Records","desc":"厂牌"}],"relations":[{"id":22985,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f7/2b/22985_uoFW6.jpg","title":"The Lion King","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/22985"}]}
