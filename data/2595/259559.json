Kunio and Riki actually gain experience, RPG-style, as well as equip weapons and use items that their enemies drop, learning new moves and special skills, but there's no money - so you can't buy anything. That said, there's a day/night cycle implemented into the game, and certain places are only open at certain times of the day. You can also play some minigames to earn some extra items!","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>初代热血硬派</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32918\">TECHNOS JAPAN</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32918\">TECHNOS JAPAN</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Shodai Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ARPG、Beat 'em up</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年8月7日</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"staff":[{"id":32918,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/1f/90/32918_prsn_yuw5W.jpg","name":"TECHNOS JAPAN","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":130008,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6c/dc/130008_Wu810.jpg","title":"熱血硬派くにおくん","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/130008"},{"id":293825,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e6/4d/293825_eQGh2.jpg","title":"熱血硬派くにおくん","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/293825"},{"id":80137,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b1/b0/80137_D6f6T.jpg","title":"新・熱血硬派くにおたちの挽歌","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/80137"}]}
