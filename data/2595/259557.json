It may not be as complete as the Nintendo legend, but it’s also more original and more inventive. The gameplay is excellent and the universe is one of a kind, so you shouldn’t miss out on this one. Besides, there really is a bazooka!","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>枪手的考验</li><li><span>别名: </span>西部英豪 枪手的考验</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Gunple: Gunman's Proof</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Ganpuru: Gunman's Proof</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ARPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1997年1月31日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Lenar</li><li><span>发行: </span>ASCII</li>"}
