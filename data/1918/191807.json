Casey's break up with Max was difficult, but she put her energy into her participation in Panhellenic. Meanwhile, Rusty struggles to keep up his GPA while still participating in Kappa Tau activities, and Cappie enlists himself as help. Calvin and Grant quietly begin a relationship, and Evan helps them keep it a secret from the rest of Omega Chi. Rusty and Jordan take their relationship to the next level, but due to a once in a lifetime opportunity Jordan moves to New York, and the two split up. Cappie and Evan's friendship is discovered by Casey and the three are friends again. When Thanksgiving rolls around Cappie and Casey share a special moment and get back together. Dale and Rusty begin to fight when they are put up for the same academic grant. In the final episode of the season, Cappie and Evan make a deal to unite their houses against Officer Huck, but Evan betrays Cappie. The Gamma Psi house burns down, and ZBZ may be to blame.\r\n\r\nAfter the break, the ZBZ sorority is extremely nervous about burning down the Gamma Psi's house, later confirmed by the fire brigade. Casey quickly confesses to Katherine, tempered with the proof that Gamma Psi cheated in Song Fest, but their relationship becomes strained. After, Rusty wins the grant and gains some fame in the engineering world, but agrees to let Dale use some of his equipment. Dale, now needing to fund his own project, agrees to be the new ZBZ hasher. Grant finally comes out of the closet and adapts to his new lifestyle, which puts a bit of friction in his relationship with Calvin, leading to an eventual break-up shortly before Spring Break. Cappie still hasn't declared a major, which strains his relationship with Casey, who has decided to go to law school. Rebecca gets scared when Evan gets serious with her, and sleeps with Beaver and kisses a random guy, leading to Evan breaking up with her. Over Spring Break, the KT house sets out a plan to get revenge on the Omega-Chis: make Calvin the next president. Ashleigh gets a job as a trend forecaster. Casey isn't accepted into CRU law but plans to go to George Washington law, which makes Cappie break up with her. Evan and Rebecca make up.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>联谊会 第三季</li><li><span>集数: </span>20</li><li><span>开始: </span>2009-08-31</li><li><span>结束: </span>2010-03-29</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt1480398</li>","eps":[{"id":661648,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661648","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661649,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661649","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661650,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661650","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661651,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661651","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661652,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661652","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661653,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661653","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661654,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661654","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661655,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661655","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661656,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661656","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661657,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661657","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661658,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661658","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661659,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661659","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661660,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661660","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661661,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661661","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661662,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661662","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661663,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661663","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661664,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661664","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661665,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661665","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661666,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661666","type":0,"sort":19,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":661667,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/661667","type":0,"sort":20,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":191805,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/bb/7a/191805_e7M7M.jpg","title":"Greek (Season 2)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/191805"},{"id":191809,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c4/24/191809_DbB5b.jpg","title":"Greek (Season 4)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/191809"}]}
