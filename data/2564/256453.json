An early real-time strategy game, it predates the genre-popularizing Dune II, being released first in Japan in 1989 and worldwide the following year. It is the sequel to Herzog, which was available on the Japanese MSX and PC-8801 personal computers.\r\nHerzog Zwei combines the arcade-style play of Technosoft's own Thunder Force series with a simple, easy-to-grasp level of strategy. It has been cited as an inspiration to the developers of Warcraft, Starcraft, Dune II, and Command & Conquer. It is also considered a precursor to the MOBA genre.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>离子战机</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38925\">テクノソフト</a> (Technosoft)</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38925\">テクノソフト</a> (Technosoft)</li><li><span>别名: </span>Herzog Zwei</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>雷霆计划</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>公爵2</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RTS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1989年12月15日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38925,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/1f/dc/38925_prsn_qZ9Pg.jpg","name":"Technosoft","desc":"开发"}]}
