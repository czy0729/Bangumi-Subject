It is the fourth installment in Technosoft's Thunder Force series, and the third and final one created for the Mega Drive. It was developed by the team at Technosoft that ported Devil's Crush to the Mega Drive rather than the team that developed the previous Thunder Force games. Like its predecessors, it is a horizontally scrolling shooter, but it also features extensive vertical scrolling with large playing fields.\r\nThe game was considered by journalists as one of the best shooters on the Mega Drive when it was launched. Critics especially praised the game's graphics, including the vertical and parallax scrolling for illustrating the immense environments. Some believed that underneath the graphical sheen, the gameplay was relatively average however. Thunder Force IV was rerelased on the Sega Saturn in Japan in 1996, and will be rereleased again worldwide in 2018 for the Nintendo Switch.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>雷霆力量4</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38925\">テクノソフト</a> (Technosoft)</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38925\">テクノソフト</a> (Technosoft)</li><li><span>别名: </span>闪电出击4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Thunder Force IV</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Lightening Force: Quest for the Darkstar</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年7月24日</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"Technosoft","count":1},{"name":"1992","count":1},{"name":"MD","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":38925,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/1f/dc/38925_prsn_qZ9Pg.jpg","name":"Technosoft","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":80910,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/73/be/80910_Bzi49.jpg","title":"サンダーフォースIII","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/80910"},{"id":258801,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/69/50/258801_G1eGM.jpg","title":"サンダーフォースV","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/258801"}]}
