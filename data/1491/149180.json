He wanders into the \"keep out\" cave, full of things like scissors, knives, and fountain pens that are not for baby and begins smashing watches with hammers and playing with giant matches. The matches chase after him; baby escapes by riding a bar of soap across a pond, but the smoke from the matches turns into boogey-men. The benevolent sandman, dressed as a wizard, spots baby hiding and works his magic, bringing us back to the real nursery.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>摇篮曲的乐土</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1933</li><li><span>片长: </span>7min</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>导演: </span>Wilfred Jackson</li>","collection":{"collect":9},"tags":[{"name":"1933","count":4},{"name":"短片","count":4},{"name":"欧美","count":2},{"name":"迪士尼","count":2},{"name":"其它","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":913582,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/913582","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
