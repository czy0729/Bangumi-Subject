A demonic figure captures an upper-class lady and does battle with her lord, damaging much of the shop. But the demon proves to have a glass jaw and, literally, a yellow streak, and the happy couple is soon reunited. No dialogue, but some signs are in English, particularly the final punch-line.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>陶瓷店</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1934-01-13</li><li><span>片长: </span>8min</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>导演: </span>Wilfred Jackson</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"1934","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":913819,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/913819","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
