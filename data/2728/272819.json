When Aido is mistakenly shot by the CIRA, headed by renowned thug Christopher \"Git\" Loughman, Nidge plays the diplomat and tries to smooth things over. Darren, however, isn't prepared to let the matter lie and decides to throw a pipe bomb at Git's car. Although Nidge denies all knowledge of the attack, as a way of calming the situation, he persuades Git to join him and the gang for St. Patrick's day celebrations. The evening goes off without a hitch until Tommy catches a drunken Git trying to rape Siobhan, and all hell breaks loose. When Darren is forced to intervene, he decides that the best course of action is silence Git forever.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>爱恨两边缘 第三季</li><li><span>主演: </span><a href=\"/person/34171\">Robert Sheehan</a></li><li><span>集数: </span>6</li><li><span>开始: </span>2012-11-11</li><li><span>结束: </span>2012-12-16</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>爱尔兰</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>45mins</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt2314701</li>","eps":[{"id":854799,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/854799","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":34171,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b0/ff/34171_prsn_288Wt.jpg","name":"罗伯特·席安","desc":"主演"}],"relations":[{"id":122174,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c6/b2/122174_T00rn.jpg","title":"Love/Hate Season 2","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/122174"},{"id":191856,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0e/a8/191856_0ZiGA.jpg","title":"Love/Hate Season 4","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/191856"}]}
