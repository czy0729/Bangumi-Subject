The series, which is directed by Jake Rowell (Call of Duty, Final Fantasy, Superman Returns), has been designed as beautiful moments in passing or a collection of memories that powerfully tap into the vast potential of VR. The debut episode, featuring an incredible close encounter with an 80 foot whale, is already recognized as one the most iconic room scale VR experiences to date (a Sundance Film Festival 2016 selection). Additional episodes in this bundle take place on a teeming coral reef and in the very deepest region of the ocean. Gain access to new modes of discovery in each episode. Slow time and capture pictures in Inspector Mode, and return to a meditative version of each location in Ambient Mode.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>蔚蓝</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>VR</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2016年4月5日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"VR","count":1}]}
