Six months on, Lady Mary mourns Matthew, and feels little attraction to baby George. The Earl and Branson dispute the management of the estate and struggle to pay death duties. Miss O'Brien suddenly leaves to serve Lady Flintshire, on her way to India. Needing a maid in a hurry, Cora hires former maid Edna, who has trained as a ladies' maid, on the strength of the reference which Tom persuaded Mrs Hughes to give her; Carson and Mrs Hughes see trouble ahead, and warn Tom to keep his distance. Mr Molesley loses his job; the Dowager Countess tries to help him by letting him serve at a luncheon for a friend who needs a butler, but her own butler, fearing he is to be replaced, sabotages his efforts, making him appear clumsy and inexperienced. The servants are excited by Valentine's Day, and Mrs Patmore struggles to deal with an electric whisk.[82] Tom asks Carson to talk to Mary to bring her out of her shell, to help him implement the changes Matthew started; he does, but she regards it as impertinence. She later apologises, and has a good cry, and the episode ends with her joining the tenants' luncheon, no longer dressed in black, ready to tackle the problems of the estate.","status":"Air"},{"id":315022,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/315022","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Episode Two","name_cn":"","duration":"00:47:12","airdate":"2013-09-29","comment":0,"desc":"March 1922. A letter is found from Matthew, appointing Mary his sole heir; the Earl is not pleased at this, nor that Mary wants to work with him and Tom on the estate management - he wants to run things on his own. Violet secretly supports Mary, and urges her to learn the business from Tom. Learning that Moseley has fallen on hard times, is working as a labourer, and has debts, Bates gets money from the Dowager Countess, and pretends he's paying back Moseley for an earlier loan. Lady Rose and Anna go to a tea dance in York which turns out to be for the servant class; she dances with an under-gardener, but when another man tries to cut in, a fight ensues, and they have to run for it. The Earl announces that his solicitor has confirmed that Matthew's letter is as good as a Will, and everyone wants him to include Mary in his plans.","status":"Air"},{"id":315023,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/315023","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Episode Three","name_cn":"","duration":"00:47:22","airdate":"2013-10-06","comment":7,"desc":"A house party is held, including a performance by Dame Nellie Melba (Kiri Te Kanawa).

Lady Mary renews her acquaintance with the suave Lord Gillingham, who flirts mildly with her. His valet Mr Green gets too familiar with Anna, and whilst Dame Nellie is singing, he violently assaults and rapes her. Another guest, Lord Sampson, wins heavily at poker; Mr Gregson, Edith's publisher friend, believes him to be a card sharp, and uses his own skill in that field to get their money back.

They go to a jazz club, where Rose dances with a black singer, to the discomfort of the others. Anna feels she is no longer worthy of Bates, and avoids him, to his puzzlement. She moves back to the house from their cottage. Edith's friend Mr Gregson is about to depart for Germany; if he becomes a citizen, he may be able to divorce his insane wife. Lady Rosamund discovers that Edith has been out at night with Gregson, and warns her of the danger to her reputation.

Carson considers re-hiring the morose Mr. Molesley if Alfred leaves, but he's not happy about the demotion back to footman; unfortunately he dithers for too long over whether to accept, and loses the chance. Thomas sees Cora's new ladies maid Baxter as a replacement for Miss O'Brien, and wants her to make friends with everyone, and spy on them for him. When a tenant farmer dies owing lots of rent, Mary and Tom want to end the lease and run the farm themselves, but the son appeals directly to The Earl, who lends him money and agrees he can continue to farm. Cora has to persuade a nervous Mrs. Patmore to exchange their ice-box for a refrigerator. Edith visits a London doctor to see if she is pregnant. Tom still feels he doesn't belong, and considers moving to the USA. Bates continues to pressure Anna, and tells Mrs Hughes he'll resign if she doesn't tell him the truth; she does, but denies it was Mr. Green, saying it was a stranger who broke in. Bates talks to Anna, and says he loves her more than ever; they reconcile. When Mrs Hughes tells him she's happy it's all over, Bates makes it clear that it is not - he still suspects it was Green. The Dowager Countess employs a new gardener as a favour to the kindly Mrs Crawley, but when she catches him snooping around the house she becomes convinced that he has stolen from her.","status":"Air"},{"id":315026,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/315026","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Episode Six","name_cn":"","duration":"00:47:26","airdate":"2013-10-27","comment":1,"desc":"June 1922. Alfred gets a place on the Ritz cooking course when a winner drops out, and leaves Downton. Carson is not keen for Molesley to replace him, even when he begs for his job back; Mrs Hughes softens his heart, and Molesley is re-hired. Edith is worried that there is still no news of Gregson, and is told by her doctor that she is pregnant. Bates and Anna go out for a meal at a posh hotel, where a snooty maître d tries to bar them; luckily Cora is there too, and ensures that they are admitted. Isobel finds the item the Dowager Countess thought her gardener had stolen down the side of a chair; she is ready to berate her some more, but is deflated when the Dowager reveals that she has already apologized to the young man, and re-hired him. Rose arranges for the band from the jazz club to play for Robert's birthday; Carson is scandalized to see Jack, the black singer, but later calms down. The Earl and the family are also surprised to varying degrees, but deal with it with their customary good manners. After the party, Mary sees Rose and Jack kissing in the servants' quarters. Government inspectors arrive to check the estate: Mr Napier is another old friend of Mary's; his companion Mr Blake is an acerbic socialist, who clashes with her - terribly politely, of course.","status":"Air"},{"id":315027,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/315027","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Episode Seven","name_cn":"","duration":"00:47:32","airdate":"2013-11-03","comment":1,"desc":"Robert leaves for America to bail out Cora's playboy brother.
