It was ported to several other platforms by Lucasfilm Games, who gave it the name Pipe Dream and acted as general distributors for the US. In this game, the player must connect randomly appearing pieces of pipe on a grid to a given length within a limited time.\r\nThe Windows version of the game was included in the MS Windows Entertainment Pack. In 1990, it was released as an arcade game by Japanese manufacturer Video System Co. Ltd., though with slightly altered gameplay, giving the player the task to connect a source and drain with the random pipe pieces.\r\nLong after its initial release, the Pipe Mania concept re-emerged as a minigame representing hacking or security system bypassing in larger video games.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>水管之梦</li><li><span>别名: </span>Pipe Mania</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>パイプドリーム</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>接水管</li><li><span>平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Apple II</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>C64</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>X68000</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GB</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC88 / 98</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1989年6月</li><li><span>开发: </span>The Assembly Line</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
