Unlike the other games in the series, Wanpaku Graffiti was released only on the Family Computer and is Japanese exclusive. It is also the first Splatterhouse game to be released for a home console.\r\nThe game itself differs from the other Splatterhouse games, in that its characters are \"super deformed\". It also takes a comical approach to its presentation, parodying horror movies and by incorporating other pop-culture references related with the genre into itself.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>腐尸之屋：顽皮的涂鸦</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38817\">ナウプロダクション</a> (Now Production)</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>鬼屋冒险</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1989年7月31日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38817,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/88/83/38817_prsn_c6KkB.jpg","name":"Now Production","desc":"开发"},{"id":1598,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9c/19/1598_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"南梦宫","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":252119,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/70/44/252119_mrsBc.jpg","title":"スプラッターハウス","type":"主线故事","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/252119"}]}
