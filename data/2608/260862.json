It was released in Japan on February 19, 1994 and in North America on December 10, 1994 and in Europe in 1995. The SNES version was released in North America in December 1994. The NES version of the game is the last licensed game release for that system in North America before its discontinuation in 1995, and is the only NES game to have an ESRB rating, as it was released shortly after the rating system went into effect.\r\nWario's Woods is a falling block game where the objective is to clear the playing field of monsters by using bombs, arranging them into rows of matching colors. Unlike other puzzle games such as Tetris, where the player directly manipulates the game pieces, the player controls Toad, who moves around the playing field and arranges them after they have fallen.\r\nThe game was re-released multiple times, first as a broadcast on the Satellaview from April 23, 1995 to June 30, 2000, and as a Virtual Console title for the Wii in 2006 and for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U in 2013.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>瓦里奥之森</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/6734\">任天堂</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/6734\">任天堂</a></li><li><span>监修: </span><a href=\"/person/39724\">山内溥</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Wario's Woods</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>ワリオの森 再び</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Wario's Woods: Again</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>瓦里奥森林</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>瓦力欧的木头方块</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>坏莉欧森林</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>VC (3DS, Wii, Wii U)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年2月19日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"PUZ","count":1},{"name":"FC","count":1}],"crt":[{"id":75184,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a2/0c/75184_crt_fFphj.jpg","name":"瓦力欧","desc":"主角"}],"staff":[{"id":6734,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6f/d9/6734_prsn_ygMvd.jpg","name":"任天堂","desc":"开发"},{"id":39724,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ab/a6/39724_prsn_DFIjF.jpg","name":"山内溥","desc":"监修"}]}
