Randomizer is apparently memoryless, or close to it.\r\n\r\nThe game does have lock delay, uses step reset, and has smooth fall and rotate animation, just like The New Tetris (with all of its problems with overhangs)","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超级俄罗斯方块3</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/11272\">トーセ</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>スーパーテトリス3</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1-4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年12月16日</li><li><span>发行: </span>BPS</li>","staff":[{"id":11272,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/19/0e/11272_prsn_Jltqe.jpg","name":"东星软件","desc":"开发"}]}
