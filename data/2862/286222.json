Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck. The game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>爆炸猫</li><li><span>平台: </span>桌游</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>2 - 5 (最佳: 4人)</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2015年</li><li><span>游戏时间: </span>15 分钟</li><li><span>适合年龄: </span>7+</li><li><span>美工: </span>Matthew Inman | Elan Lee | Shane Small</li><li><span>发行: </span>Ad Magic, Inc. | ADC Blackfire Entertainment</li><li><span>设计师: </span>Matthew Inman | Elan Lee | Shane Small</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"棋牌","count":1},{"name":"桌游","count":1}]}
