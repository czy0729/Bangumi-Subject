Expanding on the previous two-and-a-half hours of soundtrack with another full hour of deep and delicate Euflorian headspaces. Ambient, but not without a pulse. Melodic in the way that winding tree branches organically grow outward and upward. Organic and alive.\r\n　　credits\r\n　　released 20 July 2011\r\n　　W/P by Brian Grainger. Photos courtesy of Eufloria.
