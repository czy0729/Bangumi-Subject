The cartridge presents a simple game of one-on-one basketball playable by one or two players, one of the few early Atari 2600 titles to have a single-player mode with an AI-controlled opponent. Miller wrote a version of Basketball for the Atari 8-bit family with improved graphics, published in 1979. That same year an arcade version similar to the computer port was released by Atari but in black and white. The arcade game was written by Chris Downend.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>雅达利篮球（1978）</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1978年12月</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Alan Miller</li><li><span>程序: </span>Alan Miller (Atari 2600), Chris Downend (街机)</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
