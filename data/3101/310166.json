Both games were programmed by Howard Delman.\r\n\r\nPlayers must cooperate to drive the truck through traffic as far as possible without crashing. While the game can be played with one player, it was primarily designed for two. The front player steers the tractor of the truck sitting down, controlling the gas and brakes, while the rear player stands, and steers the tiller for the rear wheels, controlling the swing of the trailer. The cabinet also provides the players with bells and horns, although these have no use in the actual game.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Smokey Joe</li><li><span>平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RAC</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1978年</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Howard Delman</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
