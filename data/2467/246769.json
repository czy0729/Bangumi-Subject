It was the first project for Planet Moon Studios, which consisted of former Shiny Entertainment employees who had worked on the game MDK. Giants went through four years of development before Interplay Entertainment published it on December 6, 2000, for Microsoft Windows. A Mac OS X port was published by MacPlay in 2001 and the game was also ported to the PlayStation 2 later that year.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>巨人：卡布托公民</li><li><span>发行: </span>MacPlay (Mac OS X)、<a href=\"/person/28805\">Interplay Entertainment</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/37681\">Mark Morgan</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS X</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>TPS / RTS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人(Win/Mac OS X)</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2000-12-06(Win)，2001-12-20(PS2)</li><li><span>开发: </span>Planet Moon Studios</li>","staff":[{"id":28805,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/30/2f/28805_prsn_8oOfF.jpg","name":"Interplay娱乐","desc":"发行"},{"id":37681,"image":"","name":"马克·摩根","desc":"音乐"}]}
