Kate attempts to audition as a singer; she first leaves the audition, because she sees only skinny women there, but decides to come back and go through with it. She is rejected, but because of her inexperience, not her weight. Kevin and Toby argue about how close Kevin is with Kate.

After the episode taping, Beth learns from Kevin that Randall only risked failure once: in asking her out. Beth reassures Randall they can go through with their plan. In flashbacks, Jack confesses to teenage Kate that he has an alcoholism problem. Jack (when on the wagon before) vented his anger on a punching bag; this time, he lets Rebecca take him to an AA meeting.","status":"Air"},{"id":749389,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/749389","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Déjà Vu","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2017-10-10","comment":0,"desc":"On Kevin's movie set, Kate—excited that Sylvester Stallone is his co-star—bonds with \"Sly\" and tells him what his films meant to her father, and about his death.
