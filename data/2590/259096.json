It is the last part of the Streets of Rage series. It was later released for the Japanese version of Sonic Gems Collection for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2, and for the Wii Virtual Console on September 24, 2007. The game also appeared in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.\r\nThe game features several enhancements over Streets of Rage and Streets of Rage 2 such as a more complex plot, multiple endings, longer levels, increased difficulty, more in-depth scenarios and faster gameplay. Weapons could now only be used for a few times before breaking and could be integrated with unique moves with certain characters, hidden characters were added and a few cutscenes were included to give the story greater depth.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>怒之铁拳3</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/36047\">エインシャント</a>、<a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/8164\">古代祐三</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Streets of Rage 3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Bare Knuckle III</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii VC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年3月18日</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":8},"tags":[{"name":"ACT","count":2},{"name":"MD","count":2},{"name":"SEGA","count":2},{"name":"BeatUp","count":1},{"name":"1994","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"开发"},{"id":36047,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/70/15/36047_prsn_NZJgN.jpg","name":"エインシャント","desc":"开发"},{"id":8164,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b4/d4/8164_prsn_6jnnQ.jpg","name":"古代佑三","desc":"音乐"}],"relations":[{"id":121809,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/85/ed/79610_A8PvK.jpg","title":"Streets of Rage 2","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/121809"},{"id":259117,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/14/d3/259117_vi4T8.jpg","title":"Streets of Rage 4","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/259117"}]}
