The objective of the game is to become the fastest driver in the world by racing other drivers across several nations. The franchise is unrelated to the TV series of the same name.\r\nIt marks the first game in the Top Gear racing game franchise, and it is one of the first racing games to be released on the Super NES. This game and its next two sequels were created by the same developers as the similar Lotus series of games released earlier on the Commodore Amiga and Sega Mega Drive systems.\r\nThe game became very popular in Brazil. It inspired Brazilian company Aquiris Game Studio to create Horizon Chase, whose soundtrack was scored by Top Gear composer Barry Leitch.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>顶级赛车</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17965\">KEMCO</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Top Gear</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Top Racer</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>超越巅峰</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RAC</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年3月27日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Gremlin Graphics</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"staff":[{"id":17965,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6d/7b/17965_prsn_JtxEX.jpg","name":"KEMCO","desc":"发行"}]}
