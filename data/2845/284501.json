His beloved cafe wouldn't stand his absence while he recovered in bed, though, so I knew my duty - I gave notice at the office job I'd worked since graduating college, and entered the whole new world of cafe management! Cocoa, a girl who worked here part time in the past, has helped me out a lot by coming back to her waitress job while I learn the ropes. We were still just scraping by, until one day my former co-worker Mitsuki stopped by with an offer to work part-time at the cafe as well! Cocoa wasn't too happy, but we needed the help, so I gladly accepted. Little did I know that she wouldn't be the last busty beauty vying for my attention - and that of the customers!\r\n\r\nBefore I knew it, I found myself surrounded by four of the women most important to me in my life. It's wonderful to have them here, and without their help the cafe would be in shambles - but I could do without the stress caused by dealing with the four of them at once! I'm just lucky they're more than willing to help me relax at the end of a hard day's work...","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>Bazooka Cafe</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2004/12/17</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
