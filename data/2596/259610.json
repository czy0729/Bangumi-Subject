It is the prequel to Solomon's Key, and is known as Solomon's Key 2 in Europe and Solomon no Kagi 2: Coolmintou Kyuushutsu Sakusen (Solomon's Key 2: Coolmint Rescue Mission) in Japan. The aim of the game involves players extinguishing all fires in a level in order to proceed. They do this by creating and melting ice or kicking ice onto the fires. This game also has a level editor (which may expose some bugs that substantially affect the game mechanics), but only the Japanese version permits saving the levels one creates.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>所罗门之匙2</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/33279\">テクモ</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/33279\">テクモ</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Fire 'n Ice</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>火与冰</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Solomon's Key 2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Solomon no Kagi 2: Coolmintou Kyuushutsu Sakusen</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年1月24日</li>","staff":[{"id":33279,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5b/e9/33279_prsn_MDpkY.jpg","name":"特库摩","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":260831,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/eb/66/260831_61018.jpg","title":"ソロモンの鍵","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/260831"}]}
