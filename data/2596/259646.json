It made its debut on the Japanese PC-8801 in 1986, and was ported to the Fujitsu FM-7 and MS-DOS formats soon after. It was later remade for the Sega CD and has a sequel called Silpheed: The Lost Planet for the PlayStation 2.\r\nSilpheed is the name of the spacecraft that the player controls. Like many shooter games, the story involves using the Silpheed as Earth's last effort to save itself from destruction by a powerful enemy invasion. The original 1986 PC-88 version used 3D polygonal graphics on top of a tilted third-person backdrop. The 1993 Sega CD version later used pre-rendered computer animation as a full motion video background, a technique previously used by the Namco System 21 arcade game Galaxian 3 and later the Sega CD version of Starblade.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>高能电子战机</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/16465\">ゲームアーツ</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/16465\">ゲームアーツ</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Silpheed</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>超能电子战机</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>银星战将</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC88</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FM-7</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>IBM PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mega-CD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1986年12月5日(PC88)、1993年7月30日(Mega-CD)</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":16465,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/54/40/16465_prsn_cEokI.jpg","name":"Game Arts","desc":"开发"}]}
