The game is a spiritual and technological successor to Technos' earlier beat 'em up, Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun (released outside of Japan by Taito as Renegade), but introduced several additions such as two-player cooperative gameplay and the ability to arm oneself with an enemy's weapon after disarming them. Double Dragon is considered to be one of the first successful examples of the genre, resulting in the creation of two arcade sequels and several spinoffs, as well as inspiring other companies in creating their own beat 'em ups.\r\nOriginally an arcade game, home versions were released for the NES, Master System, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Atari ST, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Game Boy, Genesis/Mega Drive and Atari Lynx, among other platforms during the series's height of popularity. A remake titled Double Dragon Advance was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>双截龙</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32918\">TECHNOS JAPAN</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32918\">TECHNOS JAPAN</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ダブルドラゴン</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>双截龍</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>双截龙1 街机版</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Master System</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Beat 'em up</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1987年6月</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":9,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ACT","count":4},{"name":"ARC","count":3},{"name":"Technos","count":1},{"name":"Switch","count":1},{"name":"1987","count":1},{"name":"MD","count":1},{"name":"NS","count":1},{"name":"PS4","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":32918,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/1f/90/32918_prsn_yuw5W.jpg","name":"TECHNOS JAPAN","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":259613,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/14/0f/259613_66jTz.jpg","title":"DOUBLE DRAGON II The Revenge","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/259613"},{"id":259612,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3b/cd/259612_gkeFl.jpg","title":"DOUBLE DRAGON","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/259612"}]}
