Mostly low-tech in nature, with its being set in the late-19th century of an alternate world, the game's aircraft, weaponry, powerups, environments, enemies and bosses are heavily stylized adding strong steampunk elements to the style, themes and visuals of the game. Steam power, propeller-based aircraft, biplanes, dirigibles and heavily armored steam trains with giant cannons play large roles in the game's protagonists and opponents.\r\nThe original leaked Japanese arcade beta version (now rare and the source code of which is believed lost), the popular Mega Drive version and the GBA remake were all critically well received. As of 2012, a modern, \"gritty\" sequel, Burning Steel, is planned by original HOT・B lead game designer Yoshinori Satake for a 7th generation and possibly an 8th generation console.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>钢铁帝国</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/14764\">ホット・ビィ</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/14764\">ホット・ビィ</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Steel Empire</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GBA</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>3DS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>横版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年3月13日</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"GBA","count":2},{"name":"1992","count":1},{"name":"HOT.B","count":1},{"name":"MD","count":1},{"name":"3DS","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":14764,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/1f/5a/14764_prsn_711d1.jpg","name":"热乙","desc":"开发"}]}
