The game was published for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America by Tradewest, who was given the license to produce other home versions of the game as well. \r\nThe most notable difference the NES version has from the arcade game is the omission of the arcade's two players cooperative game mode in favor of alternating play. The plot was altered as a result of this change - instead of having both Lee brothers as protagonists, the NES version has players controlling Billy Lee as the lone protagonist, with Jimmy Lee serving as the antagonist and true leader of the Black Warriors.\r\nThe level designs are very different, with some stages featuring new areas (notably the cavern section in Mission 3) that feature greater emphasis on jumping over platforms or evading traps. Most of the enemies from the arcade version also appear, with the exception of Jick and Jeff. A new enemy character, a Chinese martial arts master named Chin Taimei (shortened to Chintai in the localized version) serves as the boss of the second stage and appears as a recurring minor enemy for the rest of the game.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>双截龙</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32918\">TECHNOS JAPAN</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32918\">TECHNOS JAPAN</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ダブルドラゴン</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>双截龍</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>双截龙1 FC版</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GB</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>VC (3DS, Wii, Wii U)</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Beat 'em up</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1988年4月8日</li>","collection":{"collect":10,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"FC","count":3},{"name":"ACT","count":3}],"staff":[{"id":32918,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/1f/90/32918_prsn_yuw5W.jpg","name":"TECHNOS JAPAN","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":262395,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0f/f4/262395_7ObKb.jpg","title":"DOUBLE DRAGON SOUND COLLECTION VOL.1","type":"原声集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/262395"},{"id":67943,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0f/e2/67943_YrUr9.jpg","title":"DOUBLE DRAGON II The Revenge","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/67943"},{"id":259611,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/dd/17/259611_wR36R.jpg","title":"DOUBLE DRAGON","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/259611"}]}
