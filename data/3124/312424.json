It was programmed by Greg Christensen and published by the Atari Program Exchange (APX) in 1981. Caverns of Mars became the best selling APX title of all-time and was moved into Atari, Inc.'s official product line, first on diskette and later on cartridge.\r\n\r\nThe game is essentially a vertically-scrolling version of the Konami arcade game Scramble, with the twist that after reaching the end the player must re-trace their steps back to the top.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a> Program Exchange</li><li><span>平台: </span>Atari 400/800</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1982年</li><li><span>程序: </span>Greg Christensen</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"发行"}]}
