{"id":312423,"type":4,"name":"Tempest","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ff/91/312423_dbUHQ.jpg","summary":"Tempest is a 1981 arcade game by Atari Inc., designed and programmed by Dave Theurer. It takes place on a three-dimensional surface, sometimes wrapped into a tube, which is viewed from one end and is divided into either 15 or 16 lanes, depending upon whether the tube's shape was closed or open, respectively. The player controls a claw-shaped \"blaster\" that sits on the edge of the surface, snapping from segment to segment as a rotary knob is turned.\r\n\r\nTempest was one of the first games to use Atari's Color-QuadraScan vector display technology. It was also the first to let players choose their starting level (a system Atari called \"SkillStep\"). This feature increases the maximum starting level depending on the player's performance in the previous game, essentially allowing the player to continue. Tempest was one of the first video games with a progressive level design where the levels themselves varied rather than giving the player the same layout with increasing difficulty.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>ZX Spectrum</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>BBC Micro</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amstrad CPC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari ST</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>轨道STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1981年10月</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"relations":[{"id":314877,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/01/2b/314877_9I79y.jpg","title":"Atari Force","type":"书籍","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/314877"}]}
