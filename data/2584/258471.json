It was originally released in Europe and Japan but, for unknown reasons, not in the United States. However, North America would eventually receive the game in the form of a Virtual Console release on July 21, 2008.\r\nThe game is a free moving shoot 'em up, like its side-scrolling predecessors, and essentially has the same core gameplay as the arcade original.\r\nThe soundtrack to the game was composed by Naoki Kodaka, but also features themes from the original Fantasy Zone game composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超级幻想地带</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/17913\">Sunsoft</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17913\">Sunsoft</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/32929\">小高直樹</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>SUPER FANTASY ZONE</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii VC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>横版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年1月14日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"sunsoft","count":1},{"name":"1992","count":1},{"name":"MD","count":1},{"name":"SEGA","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":17913,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/3c/00/17913_prsn_tGoT3.jpg","name":"Sunsoft","desc":"开发"},{"id":32929,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/d3/e0/32929_prsn_qSqC0.jpg","name":"小高直树","desc":"音乐"}],"relations":[{"id":252348,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/25/be/252348_5ZqUW.jpg","title":"ファンタジーゾーンII オパオパの涙","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/252348"}]}
