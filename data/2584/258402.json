Players develop their interstellar empire from the humble beginnings on their homeworld to conquer the universe, or be pummeled into the ashes of history by opposing races.\r\n\r\nSome say it has the graphical charm of an income tax assistant software from the late nineties, but a playing depth that more than rivals any commercial 4X game. Aurora is different because it places emphasis on fleet operations and detailed tactical combat.\r\n\r\nThe game is under constant development and there is an active and friendly player community in the forum that will help you with any question or problem you might encounter.
