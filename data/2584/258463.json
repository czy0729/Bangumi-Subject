Released in 1991, it centers on ToeJam and Earl—alien rappers who have crash-landed on Earth. As they attempt to escape the planet, players assume the role of either character and collect pieces of their wrecked spacecraft. ToeJam & Earl's design was heavily influenced by the role-playing video game Rogue, and took from it such features as the random generation of levels and items. It references and parodies 1980s and early 90s urban culture and is set to a funk soundtrack.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>外星双傻</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>托杰与厄尔</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii VC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PSN</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox Live Arcade</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1991年10月</li><li><span>开发: </span>Johnson Voorsanger Productions</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"JVP","count":1},{"name":"1991","count":1},{"name":"MD","count":1},{"name":"SEGA","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":256612,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a5/87/256612_lFFzZ.jpg","title":"ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/256612"}]}
