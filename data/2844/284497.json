He is also a real cat lover who can't resist taking care of any random kittens he ever comes across of. One night he got visited by a Cat God, who wanted to reward Ibuki for his kindness towards cats. Ibuki wasted no time in his reply: \"I want a cat girl!\" - he said. The Cat God immediately announced that his wish will be granted and then vanished, leaving Ibuki to wonder if it was all just a dream.\r\n\r\nSeveral days later, Ibuki is on his way home from work when he discovers that a cardboard box was left near his apartment. A meowing kind of sound could have been heard coming from the box which prompted Ibuki to open it up. Ibuki is shocked to see a beautiful naked cat girl sleeping inside. As she started waking up, she looked up at him and purred: \"I've come to serve you, for all the kindness you've shown to my kind.\" The next thing he knows, his apartment is suddenly filled with all different types of animal girls, all eager to do whatever they can for him.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>Let's Meow Meow!</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003/10/17</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"英译","count":1}]}
