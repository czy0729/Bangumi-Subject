There he learned about wine and how to serve it with style, and eventually became employed as an expert sommelier at fine restaurants. After several years of this lifestyle, he crossed paths with his former love. Sumika had grown even more elegant and beautiful since they had been together. Their meeting brought back all the old memories of their love. When she told him that she'd been made manager of a new high-class restaurant, he found himself agreeing to work there before he knew what he was doing.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to Japan, he prepared himself for his new employment at \"Platinum: Oceanside\", a very special restaurant which offers superb food, an elegant atmosphere, and to his surprise -- incredibly cute waitresses who dress in sexy bunny girl costumes! Luckily for him, these aren't just your average bunny girls. They're extremely horny, and aggressively approach Kazuma to have their desires fulfilled.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>Do You Like Horny Bunnies? 2</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2002/11/29</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"on_hold":2},"tags":[{"name":"英译","count":1},{"name":"无修正","count":1},{"name":"2002","count":1}]}
