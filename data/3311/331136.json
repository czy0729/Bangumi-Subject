Endowed with advanced technology we reached stars, colonised planets turning them into lavish paradises and went onto endless crusades against myriads of civilisations.\r\n\r\nA man on an extermination mission learns his family has been killed in a fierce attack. An attack that should never happen under the rule of omniscient and caring God Emperor. Bereaved and furious seeks for answers and vengeance, embarking onto his last journey to the place, no human has ever left alive, where God Emperor is believed to reside.\r\n\r\nIt's currently in pre-alpha stage with a public build available as a prototype/proof of concept.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>Oculus Quest</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Shooter</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2018年11月24日（v0.3.0）</li><li><span>售价: </span>free</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://void-room.itch.io/tea-for-god/devlog</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
