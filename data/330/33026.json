The idea for the programme came from the 1988 Eddie Murphy movie Coming to America.\r\nThe contestants were Remigius Jerry Kanagarajah from Jaffna in Sri Lanka; Africa Zulu, a Zulu chief from South Africa; and Manvendra Singh Gohil of Rajpipla in north west India.\r\nThe three men lived in a house together and the primary focus is on their search for a 'princess' (or in Gohil's case, prince) in the UK whilst at the same time getting used to having to do things for themselves. All three ultimately failed to find a lasting relationship.\r\nThe series was narrated by Dawn Porter. A female counterpart, Undercover Princesses, was made.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>平民王子</li><li><span>集数: </span>4</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>电视台: </span>BBC Three</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gsn9d</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"真人秀","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":146534,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/146534","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":146535,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/146535","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":146536,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/146536","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":146537,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/146537","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
