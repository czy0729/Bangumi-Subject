Hepburn: Dengeki Biggu Ban!, Blitz Big Bang!), is an action-adventure platformer video game released by Vic Tokai for the Nintendo Entertainment System on January 27, 1989 in Japan and January 1990 in North America. \r\nClash at Demonhead is an open-ended platformer in the \"Metroidvania\" style. The player takes control of Billy \"Big Bang\" Blitz, who is capable of running, jumping, and shooting. He is initially armed with a handgun, though various upgrades can be purchased from a shop, such as the boomerang gun. He later gains the ability to perform various powers by collecting Force, including shrinking, teleportation to previously-visited areas, flight, healing, and invincibility. The game is divided into a number of smaller stages, each representing a point on the over-world map. There are over 40 routes the player can take in the game, and the player must explore the world to progress. The game is non-linear in that the player can choose which direction they go, being allowed to backtrack and visit different stages.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>电击作战</li><li><span>别名: </span>Clash at Demonhead</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>电击大作战</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform-adventure</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1989年1月27日</li><li><span>开发: </span>ビック東海</li><li><span>发行: </span>ビック東海</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
