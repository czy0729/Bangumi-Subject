A remastered version for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 will be released in 2019. A spin-off of the Final Fantasy series, Crystal Chronicles was the first title released for a Nintendo console since Final Fantasy VI in 1994.\r\nPlayers take on the role of adventurers who travel in a caravan gathering mystical fuel for crystals which protect the world's settlements from the destructive Miasma. The single-player campaign has the player escort the vessel carrying the crystal's energy, defending it from enemies and solving puzzles to progress. Multiplayer, which uses Game Boy Advance units connected using the console's link cable, has up to four players protecting the vessel.\r\nDeciding to partner with Nintendo for game development following severe financial problems created by the failure of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, franchise creator Square formed the Game Designers Studio as a shell company to develop for Nintendo hardware without impacting games for Sony platforms. The development team wanted to create an accessible gameplay experience focusing on multiplayer. The music, written by Kumi Tanioka, made extensive use of medieval and Renaissance musical instruments. Upon release, the title was positively received by journalists, and was nominated for multiple awards. Reaching high sales positions in Japan and the West, it went on to sell over one million copies worldwide. Crystal Chronicles spawned a series for Nintendo consoles.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>最终幻想水晶编年史</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/6734\">任天堂</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/6284\">谷岡久美</a></li><li><span>导演: </span><a href=\"/person/39947\" rel=\"v:directedBy\">青木和彦</a></li><li><span>制作总指挥: </span><a href=\"/person/38439\">河津秋敏</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ファイナルファンタジー・クリスタルクロニクル</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>FFCC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>ファイナルファンタジー・クリスタルクロニクル リマスター</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>FINAL FANTASY CRYSTAL CHRONICLES Remastered Edition</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>最终幻想：水晶编年史</li><li><span>平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ARPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003年8月8日</li><li><span>开发: </span>ゲームデザイナーズ・スタジオ</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":2,"doing":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARPＧ","count":2},{"name":"PS4","count":2},{"name":"NS","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":6734,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6f/d9/6734_prsn_ygMvd.jpg","name":"任天堂","desc":"发行"},{"id":6284,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/35/66/6284_prsn_9v17F.jpg","name":"谷冈久美","desc":"音乐"},{"id":39947,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/78/f6/39947_prsn_ZGfZC.jpg","name":"青木和彦","desc":"导演"},{"id":38439,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/2a/83/38439_prsn_E7Fbf.jpg","name":"河津秋敏","desc":"制作总指挥"}],"relations":[{"id":20532,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/96/0a/20532_jp.jpg","title":"FINAL FANTASY CRYSTAL CHRONICLES Original Soundtrack","type":"原声集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/20532"},{"id":333084,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0d/39/333084_0wfxl.jpg","title":"Piano Collections FINAL FANTASY CRYSTAL CHRONICLES","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/333084"},{"id":4155,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/18/a9/4155_oOtRm.jpg","title":"FINAL FANTASY CRYSTAL CHRONICLES Ring of Fates","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/4155"}]}
