It bares some similarities to Mega Man and Mario series.\r\nAfter completing the first stage, the player can play the other six in any order. Each of the stages revolve around elements, such as fire and water. After each stage, the player gains a new weapon, much like in the original Mega Man series, which was extremely popular at the time. Both Whomp 'Em and the prior Saiyūki World (which was an adaptation of Wonder Boy in Monster Land) are based on the Journey to the West novel.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>西游记世界2 天界的魔神</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/18464\">ジャレコ</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/18464\">ジャレコ</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Whomp 'Em</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>西遊記ワールドII 天上界の魔人</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1990年12月7日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":18464,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/f7/68/18464_prsn_JsjjD.jpg","name":"Jaleco","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":123207,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/1b/b3/123207_HFTb1.jpg","title":"西遊記","type":"书籍","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/123207"},{"id":72031,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6d/08/72031_rVwWB.jpg","title":"西遊記ワールド","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/72031"}]}
