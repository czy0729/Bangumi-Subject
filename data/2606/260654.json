Joe: The Atlantis Factor is the title of a Nintendo Entertainment System video game developed by KID and published by Capcom in the United States in 1992. Previously, a G.I. Joe video game was released for the NES by Taxan in 1991.\r\nThe game's format is similar to that of Capcom's Bionic Commando series, with an overhead map of the various stages. In order to progress, the player must navigate the map and clear each sub-stage leading up to one of several Cobra bases. Once in a base, the player must fight through hostile Cobra forces and also complete a secondary mission (such as rescuing hostages, setting bombs, or locating a key item). Each base stage concludes with a battle against a Cobra leader (Overkill, Cesspool, Firefly, Major Bludd, Destro, and Cobra Commander).","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>特种部队2</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/415\">KID</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>眼镜蛇部队2</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1992年3月</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":415,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5c/d3/415_prsn_k6zZF.jpg","name":"KID","desc":"开发"},{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":288914,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ff/d1/288914_W4ka9.jpg","title":"G.I.
