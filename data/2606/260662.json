It features full character customization, allowing players to build a character from a toy box filled with spare parts.\r\nCocoron was directed by Akira Kitamura, who had previously directed Mega Man and Mega Man 2. Kitamura had left Capcom to form the company Takeru. The score was created by Takashi Tateishi, who also did the music to Mega Man 2. According to Tateishi, Kitamura requested \"more cutesy\" music for the game than previous titles. The artist for the game was Takashi \"Utata Kiyoshi\" Kogure.\r\nCapcom wanted to release Mega Man 3 to market before Cocoron, and they refused to delay the title despite internal problems of production.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>魔法世界</li><li><span>别名: </span>Cocoron</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Kokoron</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>可可龙</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1991年5月3日</li><li><span>开发: </span>タケル</li><li><span>发行: </span>タケル</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
