{"id":260674,"type":3,"name":"Lamplight City Original Game Soundtrack","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/eb/f4/260674_0n32m.jpg","summary":"Lamplight City. The name alone conjures up ominous scenes and sounds: a dark alleyway, seedy figures in the night, a flickering street light. The artwork opens up a window into a dystopian world, and through this setting a story of mystery, murder and the macabre comes to life. \r\n\r\nGetting to work on a project like this that is so innately inspirational is one of the true joys of being a composer. Here it is less my job to create a score and more so to uncover what sounds the game conveys all on its own. And after picturing the city streets and imagining the characters going about their lives, pieces of the puzzle started to fall in place: a high piano note for that flickering street light, tremelo and pizzicato strings for the dark alleyways, an unsettling harp for the unbreakable bond between our two detectives, Miles Fordham and Bill Leger. To have such associations flow so seamlessly is not a testament to the skill of a composer but rather the integrity of the world that the music comes to inhabit. \r\n\r\nThough I may have written the score, I share much of that credit with developer Francisco Gonzalez. Without his vision and encouragement to experiment, I don't think I would have ended up with anything close to what I have today. I only hope my music shows what a wonderful time I've had exploring every corner of Lamplight City and how thankful I am to be a part of this game. \r\n\r\n-Mark Benis \r\n","info":"<li><span>作曲: </span>Mark Benis</li><li><span>插图: </span>Francisco Gonzalez</li><li><span>版本特性: </span>digital</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>2018-09-13</li><li><span>价格: </span>7 USD</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>86m</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"on_hold":1},"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Lamplight City","href":"/ep/827754"},{"title":"2 Partners for Life","href":"/ep/827755"},{"title":"3 Slums of Cholmondeley","href":"/ep/827756"},{"title":"4 The Stakeout","href":"/ep/827757"},{"title":"5 Addy's Theme","href":"/ep/827758"},{"title":"6 On the Case","href":"/ep/827759"},{"title":"7 A Premature Inhumation","href":"/ep/827760"},{"title":"8 Lurking in Lyon","href":"/ep/827761"},{"title":"9 University of New Bretagne","href":"/ep/827762"},{"title":"10 A Victim of Society","href":"/ep/827763"},{"title":"11 St. Roch's Dog is Barking","href":"/ep/827764"},{"title":"12 The Chesterton Tomb","href":"/ep/827765"},{"title":"13 Celine","href":"/ep/827766"},{"title":"14 Prelude in G minor, Op. 23, No. 5 (for String Orchestra)","href":"/ep/827767"},{"title":"15 A Missing Gardener","href":"/ep/827768"},{"title":"16 Under Arrest","href":"/ep/827769"},{"title":"17 The Purloined Progeny","href":"/ep/827770"},{"title":"18 Gascogne Gutters","href":"/ep/827771"},{"title":"19 Metempsychosis","href":"/ep/827772"},{"title":"20 The Fallen Angel","href":"/ep/827773"},{"title":"21 Burning Desires","href":"/ep/827774"},{"title":"22 Police Chief Snelling","href":"/ep/827775"},{"title":"23 The Worcester Waltz","href":"/ep/827776"},{"title":"24 The Spectre Society","href":"/ep/827777"},{"title":"25 Aetheric Experimentation","href":"/ep/827778"},{"title":"26 The Good Man","href":"/ep/827779"},{"title":"27 A Night in the Chum","href":"/ep/827780"},{"title":"28 Riding the Dragon","href":"/ep/827781"},{"title":"29 St. Denis Cathedral","href":"/ep/827782"},{"title":"30 Crimson Cat Rag","href":"/ep/827783"},{"title":"31 A Broken Promise","href":"/ep/827784"},{"title":"32 Away from Home","href":"/ep/827785"},{"title":"33 The Justice Killer","href":"/ep/827786"},{"title":"34 A Well-Oiled Machine","href":"/ep/827787"},{"title":"35 Distant Thoughts (Upton's Song)","href":"/ep/827788"},{"title":"36 Justice","href":"/ep/827789"},{"title":"37 Justice Served","href":"/ep/827790"},{"title":"38 A Bottle of Bowlingworth Ale","href":"/ep/827791"},{"title":"39 Down Among the Dead Men","href":"/ep/827792"},{"title":"40 Opium Haze (Bonus Track)","href":"/ep/827793"},{"title":"41 On the Trail (Teaser Trailer)","href":"/ep/827794"}]}]}
