The game was released during the generation shift between the Famicom and the newer Super Famicom, and Joy Mech Fight is counted among one of the most important late Famicom games for utilizing the console's audio and visual capabilities to the fullest extent. It is also Nintendo's first attempt in the fighting game genre since Urban Champion after the success and craze of Capcom's Street Fighter II, which inspired other companies to create their own 2D fighters.\r\nThough the game's development is credited to Nintendo R&D1, it was originally conceived by two programmers, Koichi Hayashida and Koichiro Eto, who met at a programming seminar hosted by Nintendo. The two completed the game while working at the seminar, naming it Battle Battle League (バトルバトルリーグ), and Nintendo released the game under its current title after both had started to work for the company.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>快乐机器人格斗</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/6734\">任天堂</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/6734\">任天堂</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Joy Mech Fight</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Joy Mecha Fight</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>VC (3DS, Wii, Wii U)</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年5月21日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"FC","count":1},{"name":"FTG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":6734,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6f/d9/6734_prsn_ygMvd.jpg","name":"任天堂","desc":"开发"}]}
