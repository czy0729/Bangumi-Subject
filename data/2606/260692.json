At the end of the level, the player is graded from A to D depending on how many lives he/she has lost. Completing the level with no lives lost will award an A, while losing 1-2 and 3-4 will result in a B and C, respectively. Losing any more lives will result in a D, and losing all lives forces the player to restart the level. Additionally, if a player has lost several times on a level, they will be given the choice to play the map on Easy Mode. If the map is successfully beaten on Easy Mode, the player will be \"awarded\" with an E, regardless of how many lives they had lost in the level.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>忍者小镇</li><li><span>平台: </span>NDS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Tower defense</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2008年10月28日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Venan Entertainment</li><li><span>发行: </span>SouthPeak Games</li>"}
