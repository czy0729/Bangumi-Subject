That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more), but with persistent upgrades, and persistent dead heirs. In this game, your legacy defines you. Spend your parents’ inheritance and grow the family manor to give your children a better fighting chance. Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities. Your daughter could be an archer. She could also be a Vegan. Rogue Legacy 2 also lets you play how you want to. Go hard and fast, and you can dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world. Or take it slow and steady, and build your character up until you’re ready for greater challenges.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>盗贼遗产2</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform, Roguelike</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2020年8月18日(Early Access)</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.roguelegacy2.com/</li><li><span>开发: </span>Cellar Door Games</li><li><span>发行: </span>Cellar Door Games</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"银河恶魔城","count":1},{"name":"盗贼遗产","count":1},{"name":"roguelike","count":1},{"name":"橫版","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":79298,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a9/1d/79298_B9my0.jpg","title":"Rogue Legacy","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/79298"}]}
