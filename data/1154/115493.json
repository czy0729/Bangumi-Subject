This is an IDLE RPG for you to kill time. But also more interaction than common idle games.\r\nIt contains all the elements of a RPG game, \r\neven more than ordinary.\r\n-Races\r\n-Skills(decide how powerful you are)\r\n-Equipment(with entirely random stats)\r\n-A Blacksmithing system to upgrade your equipment with success rate\r\n-Rebirth system(level doesn’t mean everything)\r\n-No player class(let your skills decide what you are good at)\r\nI get a lot of ideas from Mabinogi, it’s really a good game. If you like this, you should have a try on Mabinogi.(I think it’s way better than WOW:>)","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>战斗无止境</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG Idle</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"小游戏","count":1}]}
