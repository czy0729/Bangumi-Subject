He has delegated most police duties to deputies Branch Connaly (Bailey Chase) and \"The Ferg\" (Adam Bartley). Longmire's adult daughter Cady (Cassidy Freeman) is concerned about her father—particularly his excessive beer drinking and messy housekeeping; symptoms of Walt's refusing to move on in life after the death of his wife, Cady's mother. Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti (Katee Sackhoff) is a transplanted Philadelphia homicide detective who arrived in Wyoming six months prior and is now one of Walt's deputies, and Walt’s longtime friend Henry Standing Bear (Lou Diamond Phillips) assists with any dealings with the local Indian reservation. The sheriff's office investigates a murder linked to a missing Indian girl and a mobile brothel. In the episode's opening scenes, Walt can be seen taking a shower. Scars are evident on his back. He approaches a wooden tea box in the kitchen, but opts for coffee. At the end of the episode, Walt can be seen with the box by his side. His wife's ashes are contained within.","status":"Air"},{"id":357519,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/357519","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"The Dark Road","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2012-06-10","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":357520,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/357520","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"A Damn Shame","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2012-06-17","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":357521,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/357521","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"The Cancer","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2012-06-24","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":357522,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/357522","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Dog Soldier","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2012-07-01","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":357523,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/357523","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"The Worst Kind of Hunter","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2012-07-08","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":357524,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/357524","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"8 Seconds","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2012-07-15","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":357525,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/357525","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"An Incredibly Beautiful Thing","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2012-07-22","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":357526,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/357526","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Dogs, Horses, and Indians","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2012-08-05","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":357527,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/357527","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Unfinished Business","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2012-08-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":40539,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/d5/f4/40539_prsn_zgkiy.jpg","name":"凯缇·萨克霍夫","desc":"主演"}],"relations":[{"id":92939,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/dd/1e/92939_44doH.jpg","title":"Longmire (Season 2)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/92939"}]}
