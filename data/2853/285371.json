The PC version was published by MicroProse in 1996, and the Apple Macintosh version a year later by MacSoft, in partnership with MicroProse. The game has retained a large fan base, and is still played online.\r\nMaster of Orion II won the Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1996, and was well received by critics, although reviewers differed about which aspects they liked and disliked. It is used as a yardstick in reviews of more recent space-based 4X games.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>银河霸主2</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/34931\">MicroProse</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>银河霸主2：战地行星</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>猎户座霸主2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Master of Orion 2</li><li><span>平台: </span>MS-DOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Windows 95</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Macintosh</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Turn-based strategy</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996年11月22日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Simtex</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":34931,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ae/7e/34931_prsn_6p637.jpg","name":"MicroProse","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":285370,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0a/79/285370_663zZ.jpg","title":"Master of Orion","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/285370"}]}
