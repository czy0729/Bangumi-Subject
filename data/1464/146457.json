Back at the prison, Rick tricks both the federal agents and his aspiring assassins by switching bodies with them. He then teleports the entire Citadel of Ricks into the prison, prompting a massive battle. Amid the confusion, Rick rescues Morty and Summer, and uses the Galactic Federation's mainframe to make their currency worthless. The Federation falls into chaos and collapses as a result, with the aliens leaving Earth.\r\nBack at home, Jerry asks Beth to choose between him and Rick, but she chooses Rick. After the new status quo is established, Rick reveals to Morty that his ulterior motive was to become his de facto male influence.

Beth is irritated by this and takes Rick's serum, which was timed to inject him and change him back once the family left. The family leaves and Rick is left immobilized in the open garage. In therapy, Morty and Summer respond positively to the Dr. Wong's counseling while Beth is resistant to her observations that her admiration of Rick's callousness and selfishness blinds her to the destruction it causes to her family. She struggles to openly admit that Rick turned himself into a pickle in order to skip therapy. Meanwhile, a helpless Rick is battered around by a local cat and ultimately rolls down into an open sewer drain. However, he manages to manipulate the nervous systems of dead roaches and rats to build himself a sophisticated and macabre mobile exoskeleton. He unwittingly escapes from the sewers into a maximum security foreign government building. After its director attempts to have him killed, Rick kills all the guards. The director releases a deadly political prisoner named Jaguar to take Rick out, promising to free Jaguar's daughter in return. Rick and Jaguar battle each other, but eventually kill the director and get away in a helicopter. Jaguar thanks Rick and escapes, while Rick flies to the therapy session. He admits to Beth that he intended to skip the session, and Dr. Wong concludes the session by observing that Rick dislikes normalcy and seeks adventure, and crafts relationships that punish emotions and vulnerability. As such, Beth projects this onto her children, resulting in their family's dysfunctional state. She states that the work required to maintain relationships is never exhilarating, but that it is ultimately necessary. On their way home, Rick apologizes to Beth for deceiving her and Beth gives Rick the serum, turning him human again. While Morty and Summer express their wish to continue seeing Dr. Wong, Rick and Beth ignore them and make plans to go drinking together.\r\nPost-credit scene: Rick and Morty are about to be killed in an elaborate piano death machine by a nefarious villain \"Concerto\" who has killed numerous others.
