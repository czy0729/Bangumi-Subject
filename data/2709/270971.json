Charlotte has a secret in her blood... the genetic memory of an ancestor who was in Salem at the time of the infamous witch trails: Tom Stoddard, an Assassin who witnessed a dark act with repercussions for the present day!\r\n\r\nAs Charlotte is trained in the Assassins' art, and as she begins to investigate the life of her ancestor... the forces of the Templar Order move against her. Will Charlotte learn the skills she needs to survive, and the truth she needs to prove her worth - before the Templars silence her forever?!","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>刺客信条：烈火试炼</li><li><span>出版社: </span>Titan</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2015-10-14</li><li><span>by: </span>Anthony Del Col (Author), Conor McCreery (Author), Neil Edwards (Illustrator), Ivan Nunes (Illustrator)</li>"}
