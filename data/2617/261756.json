It was subsequently ported to the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 (under the title Aero Blasters) and for the Mega Drive in Japan in 1991.\r\nIn Air Buster, the player controls a fighter jet also designed for space travel and shoots enemies, collects power-ups, and defeats bosses to advance levels. As a console game, Air Buster had the distinction of being two player simultaneous, which was rare among side scrolling shooters on home consoles at the time.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>空中破坏者</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>AIR BUSTER</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>AERO BLASTERS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>空中堡垒</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>疾风战机</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PCE</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>横版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1990年1月</li><li><span>开发: </span>カネコ</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":1598,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9c/19/1598_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"南梦宫","desc":"发行"}]}
