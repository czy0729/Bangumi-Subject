{"id":232082,"type":4,"name":"Ghost Hospital","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/17/d9/232082_YiEeS.jpg","summary":"Ghost Hospital is a game about anxiety, depression, despair, mental rock bottoms, and, of course, ghosts. You play as Robin, a twelve-year-old girl who has an anxiety disorder and is very much alive in this hospital meant for beings that are not alive. Frankly, her anxiety was already bad enough before she landed in a hospital full of dead people, the still-shambling shells of ancient ghosts who try to take her down for a sweet taste of life, and the hospital directors hellbent on keeping her contained, and more importantly, away from the reason she's REALLY there.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>RPG Maker MV</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2017-04-10</li><li><span>售价: </span>Free</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://ghosthospitalgame.tumblr.com/</li><li><span>itch.io: </span>https://spitblaze.itch.io/ghost-hospital</li><li><span>gamejolt: </span>https://gamejolt.com/games/ghosthospital/248552</li><li><span>开发: </span>SpitBlaze</li>","collection":{"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"RM","count":1}]}
