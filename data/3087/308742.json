The game was developed by Capcom for the NES in 1991 and was ported to the Game Boy in 1992. The Game Boy version is essentially a slightly stripped-down version of the game.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay consists of maneuvering Baloo's plane \"The Seaduck\" through each level, fending off incoming enemies and avoiding obstacles. Items can be collected for extra lives or too add to the total cash score. The plane can be rotated upside to traverse back through the level, but only on horizontally scrolling areas. At the end of each level, the player is required to fight a boss enemy by repeatedly shooting its weak points. After beating a level, the player has the option to buy upgrades for Baloo's plane with the money collected, before proceeding to the next level. In bonus levels the player controls Kit on an airfoil to pop balloons for bonus points.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>航天小英雄</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Disney's TaleSpin</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>航空小英雄</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GB</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1991年12月11日</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":218475,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/2b/0e/218475_LK3tq.jpg","title":"The Disney Afternoon Collection","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/218475"}]}
