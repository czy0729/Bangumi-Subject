Played as a top-down shooter, you must fight your way through a randomly generated hostile world, all the while trying to locate your emergency distress beacon and escape the planet into which your ship has crashed.\r\n\r\nWhile you’re making your way through these areas you’ll not only find weapons and items to help you; You’ll also be collecting DNA from the enemies you defeat. Then, when you inevitably die, you’re given the opportunity to combine the DNA you’ve collected to your own, granting you different stats and potentially gameplay-altering physical mutations for your next run.\r\n\r\nBeacon aims to create a bridge between fast, frenetic action and long-term strategy, where your actions can be felt and built upon hours down the line.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unity</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019/2/27</li><li><span>售价: </span>$19.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://beacon.monothetic.com/</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"EN","count":1},{"name":"美国","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}]}
