The arcades include highly detailed machines with realistic physics that are inspired by modern arcade machines. There are ticket redemption areas to exchange your counted tickets for all kinds of fun prizes. Larry's Arcade has an in-house animatronic band called Teddy and the Ticket Eaters that would love to play you some tunes while you enjoy the arcade. The most recent addition to Islandville island, UFO Arcade features modern space inspired arcade machines, Lazer Tag and an Indoor Go Kart Race Track. Make sure to watch out for the minions, they really love Teddy and his band and they also are pretty good at Lazer Tag. Run out of money? That's ok. You can work odd jobs around the island to get back on your feet. Got extra prizes? The island has a Pawn Shop that will buy your used prizes for cash so you can go blow it back at the arcade.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>模拟</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019-02-23</li><li><span>售价: </span>13.99 美元</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.devotid.com/coin-game/</li><li><span>开发: </span>devotid</li><li><span>发行: </span>devotid Media</li>"}
