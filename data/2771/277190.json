A mysterious girl in her own right, Elena, a childhood friend of Ben's, hints at an oncoming alien threat to the Earth. As such, Ben Tennyson, along with Gwen and Kevin, lend their super powered instincts (much to the latter two's displeasure) to help Elena in her mission to find her missing father, Validus.
