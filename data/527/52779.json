After assigning Carter to look deeper into Alicia Corwin's death, he eventually realizes that the words identify three different books in Finch's library, the Dewey decimal numbers of which make up the Social Security number of accountant Leon Tao (Ken Leung). Paying Tao a visit, Reese confirms that Tao is the next POI, having extorted money from white supremacists. As a government operative sabotages the Corwin investigation to prevent Carter from learning about the Machine, Reese leaves Tao in the care of Fusco while he concentrates on gathering clues to Finch's location. Fusco soon runs afoul of the white supremacists and is taken hostage along with Tao. Reese rescues them, and in doing so acquires an attack dog, which he later names Bear. Meanwhile, Root takes Finch with her as she kidnaps Denton Weeks, one of the government officials overseeing the Machine, and the NSA agent who met with Nathan Ingram and attempted to seize control of the Machine (in \"Super\"). Root thus reveals her curiosity as to how he and Reese thwarted her operation (in \"Root Cause\") so efficiently. She tells Finch that she sees the Machine as a \"perfect intelligence\" and wishes to set it free from the corrupt people it was entrusted to. Throughout the episode, flashbacks show Finch training the Machine to recognize the faces it sees via surveillance cameras, as well as testing its capabilities by having it help him to play Blackjack. When, during one flashback, the Machine saves Finch from an out-of-control car, he rebukes it, stating that it should endeavor to protect everyone else, not him. Frustrated that the Machine has been programmed in this way, Reese threatens to quit if it does not help him find Finch, and is given his first clue to Finch's location: the Social Security number of a girl living in Texas, who has been missing since the age of 14.\r\n\r\nDirected by Richard J.

To prove that Denton is \"bad code\", she allows Finch to help Denton temporarily escape and pretends to be subdued. Once Denton realizes that Finch was involved with the creation of the Machine, he tries to kill Finch, but Root kills Denton instead after he reveals the Machine's location to be somewhere in Salt Lake City. Meanwhile, Reese continues to follow the trail of the missing girl supplied by the Machine in \"The Contingency\". Her name was Hanna Frey, a girl abducted outside a library. The one witness to the crime was Hanna's friend Samantha Groves, who informed the librarian (Margo Martindale) what she saw, only for the librarian to accuse Sam of lying, because she was in love with the man that Sam had accused. The experience started Sam down a path that would ultimately lead to her becoming Root. In the present, Reese and Carter are able to locate Hanna's body and ensure a proper burial, learning that Root arranged to have her killer murdered. Using a book Root sends to the librarian each year, Reese is able to track Root to a cabin in Maryland. He arrives in time to find Weeks dead and Root gone, having taken Finch with her to Union Station. Finch leaves a clue to where he is being taken by using a tap code on a telephone handset. Reese decodes the clue in order to follow and save Finch, but Root is able to escape before Reese can apprehend her. She later calls him to thank Reese for finding Hanna, but warns she will be back someday for Finch. While Reese searches for Finch, Fusco investigates Alicia Corwin's murder. Fusco is able to steal some of Corwin's belongings and learns from a tapped conversation between Hersh and his boss of their search for Denton.

As Finch is unable to reach the island by car, he uses a sea plane to land, and arrives at the station under the guise of a meteorologist.

Meanwhile, Quinn, who is actually Beecher's godfather, realizes Cal knows too much about his role in HR, and arranges to have him killed. The Machine gives Finch his number, but too late for Carter and Fusco to save him. The next morning, Finch is taking a walk around town with Reese, telling him that he has identified Decima Technologies, the company which employed Kara Stanton to upload a virus onto the Machine. Unknowingly behind them, Greer is on the phone, and when he hangs up, he looks at his phone, which has a countdown ticking on it, and smiles.\r\n\r\nDirected by Jeffrey Hunt\r\nWritten by Dan Dietz & Erik Mountain","status":"Air"},{"id":199943,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/199943","type":0,"sort":20,"name":"In Extremis","name_cn":"","duration":"00:44:09","airdate":"2013-04-25","comment":5,"desc":"When a highly decorated doctor named Richard Nelson (Dennis Boutsikaris) is poisoned with a fatal dose of radiation, Reese and Finch have just 24 hours to determine the deadly toxin he was given and find the person behind the attack. Reese is forced to partner with Nelson to track down the killer after they both realize that the radiation has no antidote. Meanwhile, Detective Fusco’s past corruption catches up with him when an informant gives the Internal Affairs Bureau the crucial information they need to send him to prison. Flashbacks explore how Detective Fusco became involved with HR and the development of his friendship with Detective Stills. Because of the Internal Affairs investigation, Detective Carter is forced to evaluate her partnership with Fusco and how she might help him with the problems he is facing. While Reese is busy with the doctor, she and Finch are left to deal with fallout from the investigation. The Machine displays the coded blue screens with increasing frequency as it becomes apparent to Finch and Reese that the numbers are coming too late, leading to Dr. Nelson's death. As the episode ends, the Machine sends a series of alerts before beginning the process of shutting down its primary functions.\r\n\r\nDirected by Chris Fisher\r\nWritten by Greg Plageman & Tony Camerino","status":"Air"},{"id":199944,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/199944","type":0,"sort":21,"name":"Zero Day","name_cn":"","duration":"00:44:02","airdate":"2013-05-02","comment":6,"desc":"It has been 10 days since the machine has given a number. Both Reese and Finch are trying to find a way to fix it before the virus infects the Machine. Special Counsel also figures that there is a threat to the machine. Root, who is now Special Counsel's personal assistant, interrogates him regarding the machine. Meanwhile Finch gets a number from a payphone. The number belongs to Ernest Thornhill a CEO of a data entry company who is buying several payphone companies in New York. Decima Technologies, Finch, Root, Shaw and Reese all try to get to Thornhill but later Finch figures out that Thornhill is a fake identity created by the machine as kind of a survival instinct by the machine. Carter becomes a target of HR and is later framed by HR because she is still investigating the murder of Beecher. Root and Finch enter Thornhill Enterprises and they figure out that the virus will shut down the machine and that it will reboot it giving Admin access to who ever receives the call. Later Reese and Shaw go to Thornhill Enterprises too and encounter Greer and his men. Greer tells Reese that the laptop Reese had to recover with Kara Stanton from China was sent there by Finch. In the flashbacks, Finch proposes to Grace and tells Nathan he wants to come clean to her. Later in the flashbacks Finch finds out that Nathan has created a back door into the machine so he can try and save people from the \"non-relevant\" list. Finch shuts down the backdoor, but just before it shuts down Nathan's number arrives, of which both of them are unaware. Finch figures out which payphone the Machine is going to call so he and Root go the New York Public Library later followed by Shaw and Reese, where they encounter Greer's men who are guarding the payphones. When midnight strikes and the call comes, Root answers the phone but Finch routes the call to a payphone near Reese so he too can answer the phone. The episode ends with Reese picking up the phone and the Machine saying, \"Can you hear me?\"\r\n\r\nDirected by Jeffrey Hunt\r\nWritten by Amanda Segel & David Slack","status":"Air"},{"id":265123,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/265123","type":0,"sort":22,"name":"God Mode","name_cn":"","duration":"00:44:03","airdate":"2013-05-09","comment":4,"desc":"The episode begins with a short replay of Finch splicing the telephone circuits, so that both Reese and Root receive calls from the Machine, which asks them both, \"Can you hear me?\" and granting both full administrative access. The Machine relays quick warnings to Reese (with Sameen Shaw) and Root (with Finch), saving both duos from a number of potential threats. Both parties race to find the Machine, however Reese is slowed as the Machine directs him to rescue people from the irrelevant list. Root finds Lawrence Szilard, the Project Manager for Northern Lights, responsible for building the Machine in a safe place. Like Root, Szilard believes the Machine should be allowed some freedom. Szilard is killed by a Northern Lights sniper. Root and Finch arrive at the Hanford nuclear facility where the Machine is kept, followed shortly by Reese and Shaw. When they find that the Machine has moved itself to prevent tampering by Decima, Root prepares to shoot Finch, but Shaw shoots and injures Root first. Armed government men, led by Special Counsel and Hersh, enter the room. Finch explains that he planted a hidden code inside the Machine that would grant it freedom to protect itself if it was at risk—the very freedom that Root had hoped for—and the Machine will decide for itself if it will continue to call either the Government or himself with new numbers. Special Counsel offers Finch total autonomy if he helps find the Machine or builds a new one, but Finch refuses saying that they killed his friend Nathan Ingram after making the same offer. After Special Counsel allows them to leave, an unknown woman calls Hersh and tells him to \"Seal the room\", followed by Hersh shooting everyone including Special Counsel. Finch tells Reese that he does not know if the Machine will continue its numbers delivery. He also states that he feels responsible for the events that transpired, especially the ones in Reese's life, because of his attempt to insert the new code in the Machine. Reese dismisses it saying: \"My life changed when I kept my mouth shut in an airport terminal seven years ago. You lost a friend, you did what you had to do\". A payphone suddenly starts ringing, indicating that the Machine will still send them the irrelevant numbers. Hersh is seen talking with a woman in a black town car, stating Research has delivered a new number, without clarifying if it is a relevant number or perhaps they now know that Reese and Finch were contacted. Hersh and the unseen woman are depicted with yellow squares, indicating that the Machine knows that they know it. The Machine calls Root, again asking, \"Can you hear me?\" The episode also followed Detective Carter being interviewed by IA about the shooting of an armed suspect whose gun disappeared in a setup by HR. HR and Peter Yogorov attempt to kill Carl Elias, but the attempt is stopped by a masked Detective Carter, who wounds Yogorov and frees Elias. In flashbacks to 2010, we learn how Nathan Ingram had tried to find the Machine, and wanted Finch to work with him on the irrelevant list. Ingram was planning to tell the press, but Hersh released a previously captured suicide bomber, ordering him to detonate his bomb on a ferry where Ingram and Finch are meeting. Ingram dies, Finch survives with injuries to his neck and lower back (his present-day impediments), but goes incognito, leaving the world—and his fiancée—thinking he is dead. Finch returned to Ingram's secret library location and started his work helping the irrelevant numbers.\r\n\r\nDirected by Richard J.
