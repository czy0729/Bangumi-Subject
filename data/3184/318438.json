The story continues to chronicle the adventures of the \"sword dancer\" Hien and his mentor, the warrior Tetsuta. They have succeeded in rescuing the \"white dragon sorceress\" Setsuna from the clutches of the demons. However, greater challenges await the three. Setsuna's life might be in danger, and the watchful eye of the evil Black Dragon continues to follow the heroes. The adherents of the benevolent White Dragon have to prepare for the decisive battle against the forces of evil...\r\n\r\nThe game plays very similarly to its predecessor. The overall structure corresponds to that of a traditional Japanese RPG: the player navigates the heroes through top-down environments, buying supplies in town, advancing the narrative in a linear way, and fighting enemies to gain experience and level up automatically. Like in the first game, the battles are action sequences that take place in small side-scrolling areas, similarly to fighting games. However, unlike in the predecessor, the enemies are visibly walking on the screen.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/16309\">TGL</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/16309\">TGL</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>ソード･ダンサー 凶刃の女神</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>ソードダンサーII －凶刃の女神</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Sword Dancer: Goddess of the Evil Blade</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC98</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ARPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年5月26日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":16309,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/71/1b/16309_prsn_gjM7o.jpg","name":"TGL","desc":"开发"}]}
