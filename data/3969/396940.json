Later, Kimi brings Yuri to the storage cellar where they find disturbing drawings belonging to a Hikikomori named Hideo. They return Hideo’s pen to him and he draws a cute picture of the two.

Takashi realizes the strange events are tied to the lyrics of an ancient song, but reaches a dead end until seeing Rubel off, discovering the actual Kurodo Shrine is located behind Housing Complex C and makes a horrific discovery. As the day passes on, Kimi, Yuri, and Kanchan realize Takashi is missing and try to look for him. Their search takes them to the storage cellar, where they find Hideo's drawings ripped to pieces and a back chamber, which Kimi enters, finding a pile of moss and a mural of the fish people praying to the mountain god as Yuri attempts to decipher it before Kimi pleas for her not to.

That deity is revealed to have assumed the identity of Kimi, who kept the complex stuck in a year-long time loop of 2000. However, her task is made difficult by the Koshide family who are descendants of the fish people. Kobayashi tries to reach Kimi only to be killed by Mr. Koshide, as he and Mrs. Koshide have slaughtered almost all the residents. Once Kimi and Yuri retreat into the cellar, Yuri tries to kill Kimi. Having dropped her act, Kimi reveals her true nature as a supreme being as she summons the mutilated parts of Yuri's parents. Yuri immediately attempts to earn Kimi's trust only to be killed by a disillusioned Kimi, who has grown tired of her time amongst humans and proceeds to undo the loop. Having received the stone from Kimi earlier with instructions, Kanchan is forced to go against his faith and recites a protection spell so that he doesn't die. Kanchan awakens in a renamed town of Shirosaki as it should be in the present year as a white-haired Kimi watches him leave the ruins of Housing Complex C while blowing bubbles on the rooftop."}],"crt":[{"id":123675,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/73/11/123675_crt_ePrn5.jpg","name":"代角木美","desc":"高垣彩陽"},{"id":140106,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/e7/79/140106_crt_YyN9N.jpg","name":"越出由里","desc":"主角"},{"id":140107,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/87/37/140107_crt_YyXi4.jpg","name":"越出誠一","desc":"配角"},{"id":140108,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/32/89/140108_crt_tVCO3.jpg","name":"越出惠子","desc":"配角"},{"id":140109,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/bb/84/140109_crt_jjoko.jpg","name":"高村","desc":"主角"},{"id":140110,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/8a/b7/140110_crt_zSnUg.jpg","name":"和田","desc":"配角"},{"id":140111,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/43/8f/140111_crt_5YYYP.jpg","name":"百地","desc":"配角"},{"id":140112,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/78/d4/140112_crt_wW030.jpg","name":"芳井","desc":"配角"},{"id":140113,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/07/fb/140113_crt_P1pvg.jpg","name":"小林","desc":"配角"},{"id":140114,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/25/64/140114_crt_nYRjE.jpg","name":"秀雄","desc":"配角"},{"id":140115,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/da/03/140115_crt_Rl13j.jpg","name":"代角葦美","desc":"配角"}],"staff":[{"id":1286,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/da/ac/1286_prsn_866WJ.jpg","name":"Production I.G","desc":"制作"},{"id":31983,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/c3/a9/31983_prsn_338Q3.jpg","name":"Cartoon Network Studios","desc":"制作"},{"id":35633,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/65/3f/35633_prsn_ZoPeY.jpg","name":"暁","desc":"动画制作"},{"id":203,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/e2/c0/203_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"安倍吉俊","desc":"人物原案"},{"id":28247,"image":"","name":"佐々木達也","desc":"演出"},{"id":32407,"image":"","name":"太田彬彦","desc":"演出"},{"id":1677,"image":"","name":"まつもとよしひさ","desc":"演出"},{"id":1677,"image":"","name":"まつもとよしひさ","desc":"分镜"},{"id":867,"image":"","name":"阿部雅司","desc":"分镜"},{"id":39995,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/1f/61/39995_prsn_2u0KN.jpg","name":"amphibian","desc":"脚本"},{"id":39995,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/1f/61/39995_prsn_2u0KN.jpg","name":"amphibian","desc":"原案"},{"id":12417,"image":"","name":"池田ひとみ","desc":"色彩设计"},{"id":14301,"image":"","name":"針生勝文","desc":"美术监督"},{"id":31125,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/03/22/31125_prsn_2M13e.jpg","name":"柳圭介","desc":"剪辑"},{"id":12870,"image":"","name":"桜井正明","desc":"总作画监督"},{"id":12870,"image":"","name":"桜井正明","desc":"作画监督"},{"id":11380,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/18/3a/11380_prsn_TUTSO.jpg","name":"中澤勇一","desc":"机械作画监督"},{"id":11961,"image":"","name":"小松香苗","desc":"作画监督"},{"id":43690,"image":"","name":"内田陽子","desc":"人物设定"},{"id":43690,"image":"","name":"内田陽子","desc":"道具设计"},{"id":26687,"image":"","name":"石倉礼","desc":"制片人"},{"id":28247,"image":"","name":"佐々木達也","desc":"副导演"},{"id":224,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/58/46/224_prsn_WVDjU.jpg","name":"入江泰浩","desc":"OP・ED 分镜"},{"id":55436,"image":"","name":"後藤香織","desc":"总作画监督"},{"id":55436,"image":"","name":"後藤香織","desc":"人物设定"},{"id":16014,"image":"","name":"寺島真樹子","desc":"制片人"}]}
