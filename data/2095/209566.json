Players must scour the map for minerals, upgrade their gear, and attempt to blow up the opposing team all the while avoiding monsters, traps, and environmental pitfalls along the way. Maps are randomly generated and 100% destructible, so every match is a fully unique, fast-paced, and chaotic affair.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2017年2月23日</li><li><span>开发商: </span>Mighty Pebble Games Inc</li><li><span>发行: </span>Mighty Pebble Games Inc</li>"}
