The Doctor realized that the mind of William is in danger, so he made nightmare dreams where William must fight back to the end and get out of his dreams. As the Doctor calls it, this is the first phase. Throughout the game, the constant mention of a man who murdered his wife and daughter is brought up. It was believed by the staff that William was the murderer. A news report towards the end of the game says that a man was found standing over the dead body of his wife with a gun in his hand. After a brief struggle police shot and wounded the man. His daughter was found alive.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>病房</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/31121\">Gamecock Media Group</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>NDS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>第一人称射击FPS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">游戏类型: </span>惊悚Horror</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Renegade Engine</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2007-10-31 (北美)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">发行日期: </span>2008-06-26 (日本)</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.dementium.com/</li><li><span>制作商: </span>Renegade Kid</li><li><span>发行公司: </span>Interchannel-Holon (日本)</li>","collection":{"on_hold":4,"dropped":3,"wish":2,"collect":24,"doing":0},"tags":[{"name":"NDS","count":11},{"name":"恐怖","count":8},{"name":"FPS","count":7},{"name":"神奇的操作方式","count":3},{"name":"恐怖游戏","count":3},{"name":"AVG","count":3}],"staff":[{"id":31121,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/37/f0/31121_prsn_87A1b.jpg","name":"Gamecock Media Group","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":7382,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c9/dd/7382_I9t9r.jpg","title":"Dementium II","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/7382"}]}
