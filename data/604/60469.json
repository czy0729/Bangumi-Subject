Zimmer visited China in order to absorb the culture and got to know the Chinese National Symphony as part of his preparation; in addition, Timbaland also contributed to the soundtrack. The soundtrack also includes a partially rewritten version of the classic song, \"Kung Fu Fighting\", performed by Cee-Lo Green and Jack Black for the end credits. Furthermore, in some versions, the ending credit was sung by Rain. Although Zimmer was originally announced as the main composer of the film, during a test screening, CEO of DreamWorks Animation SKG Jeffrey Katzenberg announced that composer John Powell would also be contributing to the score. This marked the first collaboration in eight years for the two, who had previously worked together on DreamWorks' The Road to El Dorado and the action thriller Chill Factor. A soundtrack album was released by Interscope Records on June 3, 2008.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>功夫熊猫电影原声</li><li><span>作曲: </span><a href=\"/person/10496\">Hans Zimmer</a></li><li><span>版本特性: </span>Soundtrack</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>2008-06-03</li><li><span>价格: </span>$10.99</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>60:16</li><li><span>录音: </span>Dreamworks</li><li><span>碟片数量: </span>1</li><li><span>发行商: </span>Dreamworks</li><li><span>艺术家: </span>Hans Zimmer / John Powell</li>","collection":{"collect":6},"tags":[{"name":"HansZimmer","count":1},{"name":"OST","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Hero","href":"/ep/229195"},{"title":"1 Oogway Ascends","href":"/ep/810297"},{"title":"2 Let The Tournament Begin","href":"/ep/229196"},{"title":"3 Dragon Warrior Is Among Us","href":"/ep/229197"},{"title":"4 Tai Lung Escapes","href":"/ep/229198"},{"title":"5 Peach Tree Of Wisdom","href":"/ep/229199"},{"title":"6 Accu-flashback","href":"/ep/229200"},{"title":"7 Impersonating Shifu","href":"/ep/229201"},{"title":"8 Sacred Pool Of Tears","href":"/ep/229202"},{"title":"9 Training Po","href":"/ep/229203"},{"title":"10 The Bridge","href":"/ep/229204"},{"title":"11 Shifu Faces Tai Lung","href":"/ep/229205"},{"title":"12 The Dragon Scroll","href":"/ep/229206"},{"title":"13 Po vs Tai Lung","href":"/ep/229207"},{"title":"14 Dragon Warrior Rises","href":"/ep/229208"},{"title":"15 Panda Po","href":"/ep/229209"},{"title":"16 Oogway Ascends","href":"/ep/229210"},{"title":"17 Kung Fu Fighting","href":"/ep/229211"}]}],"staff":[{"id":10496,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/86/d2/10496_prsn_3Z33z.jpg","name":"汉斯·季默","desc":"作曲"}],"relations":[{"id":35814,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/99/ef/35814_S3jzf.jpg","title":"Kung Fu Panda","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/35814"}]}
