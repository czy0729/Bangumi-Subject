{"id":60425,"type":3,"name":"Nightmare Revisited","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/dc/a1/60425_ZZTPS.jpg","summary":"    Nightmare Revisited is a cover album of songs from the 1993 film The Nightmare Before Christmas. It was released on September 30, 2008 by Walt Disney Records to commemorate the film's 15th anniversary of its release. In addition to the album's eighteen covers are two re-recordings by original composer Danny Elfman, of the \"Opening\" and \"Closing\" tracks. One song featured on the album, Marilyn Manson's \"This Is Halloween\", was previously released nearly two years earlier, on the reissue of The Nightmare Before Christmas: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack which, featuring five covers of songs from the film, acted as a precursor to Nightmare Revisited. The album also features Korn covering \"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\". Enhanced content on the disc features the trailer of The Nightmare Before Christmas, as well.\r\n    American psychobilly band Tiger Army also provided a cover of \"Oogie Boogie's Song\", which was not featured on Nightmare Revisited, but did see release as a digital bonus track. Scott Murphy's cover of \"Sally's Song\" is also featured on Japanese pressings of the album.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>噩梦再临 (圣诞夜惊魂15周年纪念碟)</li><li><span>版本特性: </span>Soundtrack</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>2008-09-30</li><li><span>价格: </span>$18.98</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>75:49</li><li><span>录音: </span>Walt Disney Records</li><li><span>碟片数量: </span>1</li><li><span>艺术家: </span>Danny Elfman</li><li><span>发行商: </span>Walt Disney Records</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Overture","href":"/ep/228805"},{"title":"2 Opening","href":"/ep/228806"},{"title":"3 This Is Halloween","href":"/ep/228807"},{"title":"4 Jack's Lament","href":"/ep/228808"},{"title":"5 Doctor Finkelstein/In the Forest","href":"/ep/228809"},{"title":"6 What's This?","href":"/ep/228810"},{"title":"7 Town Meeting Song","href":"/ep/228811"},{"title":"8 Jack and Sally Montage","href":"/ep/228812"},{"title":"9 Jack's Obsession","href":"/ep/228813"},{"title":"10 Kidnap the Sandy Claws","href":"/ep/228814"},{"title":"11 Making Christmas","href":"/ep/228815"},{"title":"12 Nabbed","href":"/ep/228816"},{"title":"13 Oogie Boogie's Song","href":"/ep/228817"},{"title":"14 Sally's Song","href":"/ep/228818"},{"title":"15 Christmas Eve Montage","href":"/ep/228819"},{"title":"16 Poor Jack","href":"/ep/228820"},{"title":"17 To the Rescue","href":"/ep/228821"},{"title":"18 Finale/Reprise","href":"/ep/228822"},{"title":"19 Closing","href":"/ep/228823"},{"title":"20 End Title","href":"/ep/228824"}]}]}
