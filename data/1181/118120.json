I was miles away from imagining that one day, they would be selected as the soundtrack of such a beautiful video game.\r\n　　I hope you will enjoy listening to the music as much as I liked to compose it, and that it will add a little something to your journey through the garden.\r\n　　I am sincerely grateful to Erik for bringing me into the Blueberry Garden adventure, from the release of the trailer to the San Francisco prize ceremony and now, for giving me this opportunity to blog about Blueberry Garden’s soundtrack, “Et Apres”.\r\n　　Finally, I read many nice comments you left about the music: thank you so much for this ! I might one day publish the scores, but I am unfortunately not really good at writing them… I hope to tell a bit more about the stories behind the tracks in a future post. \r\n\r\nBlueberry Garden is a short experimental game about curiosity and exploration. You take on the role of a creature investigating a mysterious world to find out what is going on there. It’s probably not very much like anything you’ve played before but I hope you will find it enjoyable!\r\n\r\nFreeDL: https://www.jamendo.com/en/list/a1754/et-apres","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>蓝莓花园OST</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>2009</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>14:43</li><li><span>碟片数量: </span>1</li><li><span>表演者: </span>Daduk</li><li><span>专辑类型: </span>专辑 / OST</li><li><span>介质: </span>CD / Internet</li><li><span>出版者: </span>Daduk</li><li><span>网站: </span>https://www.jamendo.com/en/list/a1754/et-apres</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"Blueberry","count":1},{"name":"蓝莓花园","count":1},{"name":"Garden","count":1},{"name":"indie","count":1},{"name":"OST","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Et apres","href":"/ep/447842"},{"title":"2 Valse","href":"/ep/447843"},{"title":"3 Entre deux","href":"/ep/447844"},{"title":"4 La marelle","href":"/ep/447845"},{"title":"5 Ceux que j'oublie","href":"/ep/447846"},{"title":"6 D'est en ouest","href":"/ep/447847"}]}],"relations":[{"id":39275,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/df/ab/39275_x4ImG.jpg","title":"Blueberry Garden","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/39275"}]}
