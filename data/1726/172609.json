It was developed by Team17. The game was the first in the series to be in 3D and also featured several new weapons. Additionally, some of the weapons operations are substantially different from previous Worms titles. And while it is rated T by the ESRB, which is a first for the series, it is rated 3+ by PEGI, which is also a first for the series. (Before, the games were rated 7+ or 12+) It is unknown why the ESRB chose the higher rating while PEGI chose the 3+ rating. The OS X version of the game was released in April 2004 by Feral Interactive.[1]\r\n\r\nThe game was announced by Team17 in 2002 as Worms 3, featuring a different logo and initially announced to be published by Activision.[3] In 2003 the name changed to Worms 3D and Activision were dropped as the publisher. It was later announced that Sega would be publishing the game in European territories.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>百战天虫3D</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/31189\">Team17</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>GameCube</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Microsoft Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PlayStation 2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>OS X</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>炮术 策略</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>Single-multi</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>October 31, 2003 (exc.
