Founded in 1865 in the city of Cork, Murphy's Brewery is said to be the greatest competitor of Guinnes.\r\nThe British AD agency Nexus Productions expressly asked I.G for a Ghost in the Shell flavour, as Oshii's groundbreaking movie had just been released in the UK creating great sensation around Japanese animation. I.G mustered a dream team that would be unthinkable (and unfeasible) today: Hiroyuki Kitakubo (Blood: The Last Vampire) as helmer, Kazuchika Kise (Ghost in the Shell, Innocence) as character designer and animation supervisor, and Hiromasa Ogura (Jin-Roh) in charge of the background art. The 60-second film features six fierce samurai who rush through a post-futuristic megalopolis using the most unpredictable means of transport (including a kite!) as to make it on time for the last order at their favourite pub.\r\nAs the first anime style commercial film ever aired in the UK, Last Orders attracted much attention, and was presented by the local press as \"the new Murphy's commercial made by the creators of Ghost in the Shell.\"","info":"<li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>导演: </span><a href=\"/person/814\" rel=\"v:directedBy\">北久保弘之</a></li><li><span>脚本: </span><a href=\"/person/814\">北久保弘之</a></li><li><span>人物设定: </span><a href=\"/person/1192\">黄瀬和哉</a></li><li><span>分镜构图: </span><a href=\"/person/2373\">竹内敦志</a></li><li><span>作画监督: </span><a href=\"/person/1192\">黄瀬和哉</a></li><li><span>原画: </span><a href=\"/person/1192\">黄瀬和哉</a>、<a href=\"/person/814\">北久保弘之</a></li><li><span>背景美术: </span><a href=\"/person/11836\">小倉宏昌</a></li><li><span>动画制作: </span><a href=\"/person/1286\">Production I.G</a></li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1997年</li><li><span>片长: </span>1min</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/72_/</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":21,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":9},{"name":"Production.I.G","count":6},{"name":"北久保弘之","count":4},{"name":"1997","count":3},{"name":"95-99","count":2},{"name":"广告","count":2},{"name":"ProductionI.G","count":2},{"name":"Murphy_s_Irish_Stout","count":1},{"name":"TV（集数1-49）","count":1},{"name":"其它","count":1},{"name":"90年代","count":1},{"name":"Production_I.G","count":1},{"name":"黄瀬和哉","count":1},{"name":"1990s","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":784618,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/784618","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":814,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/96/b9/814_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"北久保弘之","desc":"导演"},{"id":1192,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/52/29/1192_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"黄濑和哉","desc":"人物设定"},{"id":2373,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5f/14/2373_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"竹内敦志","desc":"分镜构图"},{"id":11836,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/05/1e/11836_prsn_0psz0.jpg","name":"小仓宏昌","desc":"背景美术"},{"id":1286,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/da/ac/1286_prsn_866WJ.jpg","name":"Production I.G","desc":"动画制作"}]}
