Slow Motion View allows you to see the gun’s operation in even more detail. \r\nThe Game Mode of this application is a mind-teasing puzzle. Here, you are given the challenge to rearrange and reassemble the gun in the fastest time. These times are then recorded locally and globally in our highscore tables, where you can compete with other users. Parts are usually assembled and disassembled in a logical order, but sometimes the order is determined by specific safety or mechanical limitations.
