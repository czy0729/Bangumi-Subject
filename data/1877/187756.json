When he loses his mother, he is sure he is alone in the world. But that’s before he makes his new friends in the children’s home. Simon, Ahmed, Jujube, Alice and Béatrice : they all have their stories and they are equally heartbreaking and tender. But there’s also a girl, Camille. When you’re 10 years old, there is so much to discover – like what it’s like to have a gang of friends, to fall in love, and hey, maybe even to be happy.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>西葫芦的生活</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>别名: </span>My Life As A Zucchini</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>My Life as a Courgette</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>我的西葫芦生活</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>酷瓜人生</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>My Life As a Courgette</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2016年5月15日(戛纳电影节) / 2016年9月22日(瑞士) / 2016年10月19日(法国)</li><li><span>片长: </span>66分钟</li><li><span>导演: </span>Claude Barras</li>","collection":{"wish":7,"collect":19,"doing":1,"on_hold":1,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"动画电影","count":7},{"name":"瑞士","count":3},{"name":"剧场版","count":3},{"name":"温情","count":2},{"name":"ClaudeBarras","count":2},{"name":"儿童","count":2},{"name":"非日本動畫電影","count":1},{"name":"US","count":1},{"name":"电影","count":1},{"name":"法国","count":1},{"name":"奥斯卡","count":1},{"name":"无","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":875447,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/875447","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
