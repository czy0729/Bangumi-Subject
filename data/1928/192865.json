This was Baum's last Oz book, and was published posthumously. Most critics agree this is Baum's darkest Oz book, most likely due to his failing health. There have been many other Oz books released since, although not written by Baum.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>奥兹国的格琳达</li><li><span>作者: </span><a href=\"/person/25261\">Lyman Frank Baum</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>オズのグリンダ</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>格林达</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>欧兹国的葛琳达</li><li><span>出版社: </span>Reilly & Lee</li><li><span>发售日: </span>1920年</li><li><span>插画: </span>John R.
