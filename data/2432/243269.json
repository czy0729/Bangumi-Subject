The Fox and Crow have a band-act in a nightclub, but the Fox walks out on his partner when he gets the position of a symphony-orchestra conductor. The Fox becomes while his old partner is on skid row, cold and hungry. One night, the Crow appears backstage at the concert Hall and hands a magician's wand to the Fox as he goes onstage. Using the wand as a baton, everything that can go wrong goes wrong for the snooty maestro, and the audience begins to boo. Crow then makes his stage entry and saves the day with his one-man band routine.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>幸运魔法</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1949-03-24(美国)</li><li><span>片长: </span>7分钟</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧 / 动画 / 短片 / 奇幻</li><li><span>导演: </span>John Hubley</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Sol Barzman</li><li><span>主演: </span>Frank Graham、Paul Frees</li><li><span>IMDb链接: </span>tt0041618</li>","collection":{"collect":2}}
