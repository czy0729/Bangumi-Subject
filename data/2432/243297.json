Each segment begins with an upbeat performance of the song, follows with a depiction of the historical inspiration, and concludes with a somehow less jolly rendition of the tune. It covers \"Little Jack Horner\", \"Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary\", \"London Bridge is Falling Down\" with a clever contrast of amusing animation and serious narration.\r\n","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>鹅妈妈的真相</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1957-08-28</li><li><span>片长: </span>15分钟</li><li><span>类型: </span>动画 / 纪录片 / 短片 / 歌舞 / 家庭 / 历史</li><li><span>导演: </span>Bill Justice / Wolfgang Reitherman</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Bill Peet</li><li><span>主演: </span>Page Cavanaugh</li><li><span>IMDb链接: </span>tt0051115</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2}}
