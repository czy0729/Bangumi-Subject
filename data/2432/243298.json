{"id":243298,"type":2,"name":"Paul Bunyan","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/72/77/243298_i341a.jpg","summary":"　　This short brings to life the tall tale of giant lumberjack Paul Bunyan and his large blue ox Babe. It presents Bunyan's shore-side discovery as a baby, his small town youth, his tree-cutting journeys out west, and his standoff with the diminutive Joe Muffaw with his steam-powered saw. This is one of the better narrative cartoons of the set, though environmentalists may disapprove.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>伐木巨人</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1958-08-01</li><li><span>片长: </span>17分钟</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧 / 动画 / 短片 / 家庭 / 冒险</li><li><span>导演: </span>Les Clark</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Lance Nolley</li><li><span>主演: </span>Thurl Ravenscroft</li><li><span>IMDb链接: </span>tt0052056</li>","collection":{"collect":3}}
