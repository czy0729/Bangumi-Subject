With eldest daughter Sharon's wedding looming and the docks facing closure, times are challenging. So too are Danny's attempts to get closer to the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nCradle To Grave is based on actual events and characters.\r\n\r\nDad Fred is known to all and sundry as Spud, a proud South London docker with a penchant for rackets, fiddles and schemes. His wife Bet loves him deeply but longs for the day when they do quaint things - like put money in the electricity meter.\r\n\r\nThen there's Danny's older brother Michael, with his modish and much mocked head attire, and sister Sharon who with her plimsole-wearing boyfriend is about to take Danny to the theatre for a West End experience he will never forget.\r\n\r\nThrow in a coveted item of clothing, a rogue tortoise and an early brush with death and it's business as usual at 11 Debnams Rd.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>生活琐逝 第一季</li><li><span>集数: </span>8</li><li><span>开始: </span>2015-09-03</li><li><span>结束: </span>2015-10-15</li><li><span>类型: </span>剧情/喜剧</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>30min</li><li><span>电视网: </span>BBC Two</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b069hzgn</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4658612/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt</li><li><span>Wikipedia: </span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_to_Grave</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"on_hold":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"2015","count":2},{"name":"英剧","count":2},{"name":"亲年轻人","count":1},{"name":"家庭琐事","count":1},{"name":"家庭","count":1},{"name":"喜剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":745953,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/745953","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"1","name_cn":"","duration":"00:28:15","airdate":"2015-09-03","comment":0,"desc":"Spud's money making schemes end up giving him a nasty shock, whilst a trip to the theatre has an equally surprising outcome for Danny.","status":"Air"},{"id":745954,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/745954","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"2","name_cn":"","duration":"00:28:58","airdate":"2015-09-10","comment":0,"desc":"Bet's yearning to broaden her horizons takes her and Spud to unusual places, whilst Danny tries some exploration of his own after an enlightening sex education lesson.","status":"Air"},{"id":745955,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/745955","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"3","name_cn":"","duration":"00:28:41","airdate":"2015-09-17","comment":0,"desc":"Whilst doors are closing for Spud and the dockers, Danny witnesses the dawn of a new era.","status":"Air"},{"id":745956,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/745956","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"4","name_cn":"","duration":"00:27:34","airdate":"2015-09-24","comment":0,"desc":"Whilst Spud wonders how to make his daughter's wedding dreams come true, Danny's loyalty to the school football team is tested.","status":"Air"},{"id":745957,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/745957","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"5","name_cn":"","duration":"00:27:22","airdate":"2015-10-01","comment":0,"desc":"Danny finally gets to enter the dark room with Miss Blondel but there is no passion, leading to extreme measures (such as leaving school without telling his parents) to date her.
