It was developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo in 2003. It is the second game in the Advance Wars sub-series of Nintendo Wars, preceded by Advance Wars and followed by Advance Wars: Dual Strike.\r\n\r\nBlack Hole Rising is nearly identical to the previous game in terms of core gameplay; there was only a small change in overall graphical style and some small content additions. The storyline of this game continues from the previous game, Advance Wars. Black Hole has quickly recovered from its defeat in Cosmo Land, and has gathered forces to invade Macro Land under the command of Sturm, the same commander who led the invasion of Cosmo Land. The protagonists, the Allied Nations, cooperate once again to drive the Black Hole forces out of Macro Land once and for all.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>高级战争2：黑洞的崛起</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/7060\">インテリジェントシステムズ</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/6734\">任天堂</a></li><li><span>制作人: </span><a href=\"/person/36650\">成広通</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Advance Wars2 Black Hole Rising</li><li><span>平台: </span>GBA</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SLG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1-4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003年06月23日</li>","collection":{"on_hold":5,"dropped":7,"wish":20,"collect":127,"doing":3},"tags":[{"name":"GBA","count":35},{"name":"SLG","count":19},{"name":"任天堂","count":10},{"name":"战棋","count":7},{"name":"2003","count":2},{"name":"汉化","count":2},{"name":"经典","count":2},{"name":"16-20","count":1},{"name":"CERO:A","count":1},{"name":"ESRB:E","count":1},{"name":"日本","count":1},{"name":"nintendo","count":1},{"name":"cn","count":1},{"name":"","count":""}],"staff":[{"id":7060,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/e1/21/7060_prsn_xHM5U.jpg","name":"インテリジェントシステムズ","desc":"开发"},{"id":6734,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/6f/d9/6734_prsn_ygMvd.jpg","name":"任天堂","desc":"发行"},{"id":36650,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/33/d4/36650_prsn_cqJQq.jpg","name":"成広通","desc":"制作人"}],"relations":[{"id":740,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ed/fb/740_MIBpd.jpg","title":"ゲームボーイウォーズアドバンス","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/740"},{"id":351,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/59/c3/731_aus.jpg","title":"ファミコンウォーズDS","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/351"},{"id":339164,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/1d/ce/339164_sX36w.jpg","title":"Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/339164"}]}
