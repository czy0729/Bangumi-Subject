It was developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo in 2003. It is the second game in the Advance Wars sub-series of Nintendo Wars, preceded by Advance Wars and followed by Advance Wars: Dual Strike.\r\n\r\nBlack Hole Rising is nearly identical to the previous game in terms of core gameplay; there was only a small change in overall graphical style and some small content additions. The storyline of this game continues from the previous game, Advance Wars. Black Hole has quickly recovered from its defeat in Cosmo Land, and has gathered forces to invade Macro Land under the command of Sturm, the same commander who led the invasion of Cosmo Land. The protagonists, the Allied Nations, cooperate once again to drive the Black Hole forces out of Macro Land once and for all.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>高级战争2：黑洞的崛起</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/7060\">インテリジェントシステムズ</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/6734\">任天堂</a></li><li><span>制作总指挥: </span><a href=\"/person/36650\">成広通</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Advance Wars2 Black Hole Rising</li><li><span>平台: </span>GBA</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SLG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1-4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003年06月23日</li>","collection":{"wish":10,"collect":111,"on_hold":5,"dropped":3},"tags":[{"name":"GBA","count":31},{"name":"SLG","count":18},{"name":"大战争","count":12},{"name":"任天堂","count":8},{"name":"战棋","count":6},{"name":"高级战争","count":3},{"name":"杀时间用","count":3},{"name":"踩楼房","count":2},{"name":"AW","count":2},{"name":"汉化","count":2},{"name":"一卡多人","count":2},{"name":"经典","count":2},{"name":"IntelligentSystems","count":1},{"name":"16-20","count":1},{"name":"CERO:A","count":1},{"name":"Game_Boy_Advance","count":1},{"name":"ESRB:E","count":1},{"name":"cn","count":1},{"name":"滚吧","count":1},{"name":"日本","count":1},{"name":"nintendo","count":1},{"name":"。游戏","count":1},{"name":"难度还是很厚道的","count":1},{"name":"2003","count":1},{"name":"IS","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":7060,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/e1/21/7060_prsn_xHM5U.jpg","name":"Intelligent Systems","desc":"开发"},{"id":6734,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6f/d9/6734_prsn_ygMvd.jpg","name":"任天堂","desc":"发行"},{"id":36650,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/33/d4/36650_prsn_cqJQq.jpg","name":"成广通","desc":"制作总指挥"}],"relations":[{"id":740,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ed/fb/740_MIBpd.jpg","title":"ゲームボーイウォーズアドバンス","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/740"},{"id":351,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/59/c3/731_aus.jpg","title":"ファミコンウォーズDS","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/351"}],"like":[{"id":1312,"name":"勇者斗恶龙5 天空的新娘","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f2/9b/1312_M7EzU.jpg"},{"id":218,"name":"高级战争：毁灭日","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e9/6e/218_aus.jpg"},{"id":740,"name":"高级战争","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ed/fb/740_MIBpd.jpg"},{"id":428,"name":"生存之子 迷失蔚蓝","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/8d/7d/428_ajp.jpg"},{"id":205,"name":"马里奥赛车DS","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ea/e2/205_S6PCc.jpg"},{"id":722,"name":"黄金太阳2: 失落的时代","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c8/ed/722_hdbqz.jpg"},{"id":937,"name":"最终幻想战略版A2:封穴的魔法书","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b7/89/937_RWRJn.jpg"},{"id":720,"name":"火焰之纹章 圣魔之光石","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5f/2c/720_FNyYC.jpg"}]}
