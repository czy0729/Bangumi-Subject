The day after they move, Ash is killed returning the hire van.\r\nAt the funeral, Martha's friend Sara tells her about a new service that lets people stay in touch with the deceased. By using all his past online communications and social media profiles, a new 'Ash' can be created. Martha rejects the idea outright, however that evening Sara signs her up anyway. When Martha finds an e-mail supposedly from Ash, she furiously confronts Sara, however her friend suggests she just give it a try.\r\nOver the next few days, Martha finds her grief to be overwhelming and things are made worse when she discovers she is pregnant. Emotionally unstable, she finds the e-mail from 'Ash' and responds. She finds herself communicating with him through instant messaging, and informs him of the pregnancy. Soon after, she uploads videos and photos of Ash to the server, and as a result is called by the service duplicating his voice. Martha is overwhelmed with emotion, but allows herself to believe that she is talking to her dead partner. Over the next few weeks, she talks to him almost non-stop over her phone and keeps him updated regarding the pregnancy. After a while, he suggests buying a synthetic body that has just been marketed and uploading the program to it.\r\nMartha does this and following the program's instructions allows the body to take on Ash's physical characteristics. What emerges is a body that looks a lot, but not completely, like Ash (it is missing distinctive features, like a mole and his beard). Martha soon finds herself ill at ease with the 'clone', as it lacks certain habits that the real Ash had and does what she says without question. Things are made worse when Martha's sister (who doesn't know anything about what's happening) calls and, finding men's clothes in the bathroom, compliments her sister for 'moving on'.\r\nMartha decides she cannot take any more after an argument and takes the Ash clone to a local suicide point and orders it to jump off the cliff, but it refuses (albeit, only when Martha tells it the real Ash wouldn't have willingly jumped). After this there is a black out, and the episode cuts to several years later on the birthday of Martha's daughter. The daughter persuades Martha to allow access to the attic because it is her birthday. The clone of ash appears confined to the attic. The daughter brings the clone a piece of cake and then calls for Martha.","status":"Air"},{"id":241968,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/241968","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"White Bear","name_cn":"白熊","duration":"00:42:02","airdate":"2013-02-18","comment":17,"desc":"温馨提示：以下内容涉及剧透。\r\n\r\nIn a bedroom, a woman named Victoria Skillane (Lenora Crichlow) wakes up in a chair to find she can't recall anything about her life. Apparently the result of a failed suicide attempt, Victoria is surrounded by images of a small girl (whom she assumes to be her daughter) as well as photos of her and an unknown man. Victoria sees an unusual symbol on the TV screens in the house. Leaving the house, Victoria sees people constantly recording her on their phones. After being chased by a masked man with a shotgun, she soon meets up with Jem (Tuppence Middleton), who explains that the symbol denotes a transmitter called 'White Bear', whose signal has turned most of the population into dumb voyeurs who do nothing but record everything around them. Victoria and Jem are unaffected, but are also a target for the 'hunters', one of whom wears a mask with the same symbol that was on the TV screens. Jem plans to reach the signal's transmitter to destroy it.\r\nAs they travel, Victoria and Jem are picked up by a man named Baxter (Michael Smiley) who is also unaffected, but drives them to a forest and holds them at gunpoint. Although Jem manages to escape, Victoria is tied to a tree and about to be tortured until Jem kills her attacker. They continue travelling to the transmitter, while Victoria starts to have visions of past and future events. When they reach the White Bear transmitter to destroy it, Victoria and Jem are attacked by two hunters. Victoria is able to wrestle a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker - only for it to spray confetti.\r\nThe walls open to reveal an audience applauding after observing the escapade; Jem and the hunters are revealed to have been part of a charade all along. Victoria is strapped into a chair, while Baxter appears and explains everything; the girl that Victoria assumed to be her daughter was actually a six-year-old schoolgirl named Jemima Sykes, whom Victoria and her fiancée, Iain Rannoch (the man from the photographs) had abducted a few miles from her home. After taking her to a nearby forest, Iain proceeded to torture and kill Jemima while Victoria recorded his actions on her mobile phone. The 'White Bear', originally the victim's teddy, was a symbol of the nationwide search and murder investigation, while the symbol on the screens and on the hunter's mask was identical to the tattoo that identified Victoria's fiancée (who had committed suicide in his cell before the trial). Having tearfully pleaded guilty and insisting that she had been 'under Iain's spell', Victoria was given a sentence that the judge described as 'proportionate and considered' - to undergo this mob-recorded, poetic justice every day.\r\nVictoria, who still has no clear memory of these events, is driven back to the compound past a crowd baying for her blood (under encouragement from the staff) and returned to the room where she woke up. She is placed back in the bedroom chair, has her memory of the day's events wiped as she screams in agony, and will face the same scenario all over again the following day.\r\nOver the end credits, we see the staff of the 'White Bear Justice Park' prepare for another day as they set up the scenario. The voyeurs are members of the public who are there to see Victoria suffer while using their phones to record the show. A calendar in the house reveals that she has already gone through this ordeal at least eighteen times. The episode ends as it began, with Victoria waking up in the bedroom chair with no memory.","status":"Air"},{"id":241969,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/241969","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"The Waldo Moment","name_cn":"沃多时刻","duration":"00:43:00","airdate":"2013-02-25","comment":13,"desc":"温馨提示：以下内容涉及剧透。\r\n\r\nJamie Salter (Daniel Rigby) is a failed comedian who performs the voice and movements (via performance capture) of a blue cartoon bear named Waldo, who interviews politicians and other authority figures. The interviewees are fooled into thinking the Waldo interviews are for a children's TV programme, when they're actually for a late-night, topical comedy show. Waldo the bear is extremely popular with the British public, and a pilot for his own series is commissioned, but despite the character's success Jamie is depressed and unsatisfied with his life.\r\nDuring a brain-storming session for the Waldo pilot, producer Jack Napier (Jason Flemyng), who owns the rights to Waldo, jokingly suggests that Waldo should compete against real politicians in an upcoming by-election in the (fictional) town of Stentonford, so he can stand against one of his past interviewees, Conservative candidate Liam Monroe (Tobias Menzies). Jamie at first opposes the idea, worried about entering the world of politics, but he soon reluctantly agrees to go ahead with the plan. The production company head off on a campaign trail, projecting Waldo onto a screen on the side of a van and driving to wherever Monroe is campaigning, so Waldo can publicly humiliate him in front of the public. During the campaign, Jamie meets Gwendolyn Harris (Chloe Pirrie), the by-election's Labour candidate who is only entering the by-election to further her own political career. Jamie and Gwendolyn grow close, and they have a one-night-stand, but afterwards Gwendolyn is warned by her campaign manager to keep away from Jamie during the campaign. Jamie can't understand why she is avoiding him, and develops a disdain for career politicians.\r\nOn a TV panel show with every party candidate as a guest, Monroe mocks both Waldo and Jamie, taunting him by saying Waldo is nothing more than a joke and Jamie himself hasn't achieved anything in his comedy career. This aggravation causes Jamie to angrily rant at every candidate on the panel, accusing them of being more artificial than Waldo is, exposing Gwendolyn as a career politician and stating that the public has lost faith in politicians. Jamie is later embarrassed by his outburst, but the rant becomes a hit on Youtube and Waldo gains more public support. Both Jamie and Napier meet with a man (who introduces himself as a member of \"the agency\") who claims that Waldo's independent stance has the potential to become a global authority figure much to the disdain of Jamie and, after a heated argument with Napier, Jamie opts to leave the campaign. He tries to apologise to Gwendolyn for his actions, but she turns him away, enraged that he has potentially damaged her career. On the final day of the campaign trail, Jamie rejoins but is overwhelmed by guilt and breaks down at a rally, begging the public not to vote for Waldo, leaving the van and trying to smash the screen. Napier takes over Waldo's controls and orders the public to attack Jamie. On the day of the election, Jamie watches the results from a hospital bed; Monroe wins, with Waldo (now voiced by Napier) coming second and Gwendolyn coming third. Napier prompts the audience to riot.\r\nDuring the end credits, Jamie is shown to have become homeless, and is living on the street. He sees Waldo on a nearby monitor displaying what is assumed to be political adverts on a global scale and angrily throws a bottle at the screen, which leads to him being assaulted by two police officers.\r\nThe episode originated in an idea for Nathan Barley, an earlier TV project co-written by Charlie Brooker and Chris Morris.","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":30310,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/11/b8/30310_gpS6r.jpg","title":"Black Mirror (Series 1)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/30310"},{"id":120220,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ba/ae/120220_G3frz.jpg","title":"Black Mirror (Series 3)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/120220"},{"id":118747,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/18/50/118747_601Fc.jpg","title":"Black Mirror: White Christmas","type":"番外篇","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/118747"}]}
