\r\n　　从2003年以来播出的189集里，该片为我们验证了769条流言，它们或是得到了证实Confirmed、有此可能Plausible或是被彻底揭穿Busted，当然也有一些还不能肯定。为了揭示真相，流言终结者们把许多东西炸毁、打爆或扔到水里，其中包括热水器还有汽车（其中一辆是该节目一位年轻观众的父母的）。不过《流言终结者》不是专门搞破坏的——这是他们的工作需要。虽然不是每次实验都能成功，但Jamie、Adam和制作小组坚持用科学的方法，进行合理的实验。他们最初的想法就是寓教于乐——把科学和娱乐结合起来。\r\n　　后来终结流言竟大受欢迎。在世界各地《流言终结者》每周约有1000多万观众收看，迅速成为探索频道收视率最高的节目。一般每集会有一个专题，解决2～4个相关的流言。《流言终结者》还有一些主题节目，如和热门电影相关的流言：《加勒比海盗》秀、《大白鲨》秀，以及观众推荐的流言。节目流行以后，两位主持人甚至在热门的推理情节剧《犯罪现场调查》（CSI：Crime Scene Investigation）中客串表演。","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>流言终结者 第一季</li><li><span>别名: </span>怪しい伝説</li><li><span>集数: </span>8</li><li><span>开始: </span>September 23, 2003</li><li><span>结束:
