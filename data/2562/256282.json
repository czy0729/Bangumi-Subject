Aiding them in this task are a variety of weapons and power-ups that can be used to battle the numerous enemies in each level. Various elements and aspects of horror movies are referenced in the game with some of its more violent content being censored in various territories such as Europe and Australia, where it is known only as Zombies.\r\nWhile not a great commercial success, the game was well received for its graphical style, humor and deep gameplay. It spawned a sequel, Ghoul Patrol, released in 1994.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>僵尸邻居</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32894\">LucasArts</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>邻居不是人</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Zombies</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Run and gun</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年7月</li>","staff":[{"id":32894,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/68/8b/32894_prsn_2pRjR.jpg","name":"LucasArts","desc":"开发"},{"id":747,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/c1/747_prsn_43cah.jpg","name":"科乐美","desc":"发行"}]}
