{"id":256212,"type":4,"name":"Lemmings","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/07/01/256212_sU0n1.jpg","summary":"Lemmings is a puzzle-platformer video game originally developed by DMA Design and published by Psygnosis for the Amiga in 1991 and later ported for numerous other platforms. The game was programmed by Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint.\r\nThe objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.\r\nLemmings was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second-highest rated game in the history of Amstrad Action, and was considered the eighth-greatest game of all time by Next Generation in 1996. Lemmings is also one of the most widely ported and best-selling video games, and is estimated to have sold around 20 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several sequels, remakes and spin-offs, and has also inspired similar games.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>疯狂小旅鼠</li><li><span>别名: </span>百战小旅鼠</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>旅鼠总动员</li><li><span>平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>DOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari ST</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC98</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PCE</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>3DO</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GB</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GBC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GG</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1991年2月14日</li><li><span>开发: </span>DMA Design (Rockstar North)</li><li><span>发行: </span>Psygnosis</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"MD","count":1}]}
