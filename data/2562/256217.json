Super Turrican was also released on the Virtual Console in Europe and Australia on February 29, 2008, and in North America on March 3, 2008.\r\nSuper Turrican was developed by Factor 5 and published by Seika. It plays similarly to Mega Turrican (also developed by Factor 5) and shares a similar visual style. The game has a different set of levels, however, and features a freeze beam in place of the original lightning whip. The game only features 4 worlds and ends with the H. R. Giger inspired alien boss, despite a representation of 'the machine', similar to that featured in Mega Turrican, appearing in the prologue.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>超级战士</li><li><span>别名: </span>超级炮塔</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Virtual Console</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年5月</li><li><span>开发: </span>Factor 5</li><li><span>发行: </span>Seika Corp.</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"relations":[{"id":256150,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/aa/01/256150_zRbXB.jpg","title":"Super Turrican 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/256150"},{"id":314093,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ba/09/314093_ErPaP.jpg","title":"Turrican","type":"相同世界观","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/314093"}]}
