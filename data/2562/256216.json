{"id":256216,"type":4,"name":"Kirby's Avalanche","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/71/73/256216_4oNll.jpg","summary":"Kirby's Avalanche, known in Europe as Kirby's Ghost Trap, is a puzzle video game co-developed by HAL Laboratory, Compile and Banpresto. It was released by Nintendo on February 1, 1995 in Europe and in April 25, 1995 in North America for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the Western release of Japanese Super Puyo Puyo. It is also the only Kirby game not to be released in Japan.\r\nWhile the core gameplay remains the same, the Japanese and Western versions are drastically different cosmetically. As the story in Super Puyo Puyo is more focused on Arle and Carbuncle's adventures like the Madou Monogatari and Mega Drive Puyo Puyo versions, the Western version replaced them with Kirby characters to appeal to Western audiences.\r\nAs a game released later in the SNES's life cycle, this game has bright colors and advanced graphics for its time. The sound consists of remixed tracks from Kirby's Adventure and Kirby's Dream Course, with only one original track from the Puyo Puyo game itself (the panic music). As the game boots, a sampled \"Kirby's Avalanche!\" or \"Kirby's Ghost Trap!\" can be heard.\r\nBoth versions have cinematics between each round, with differences being Kirby and his opponents shown having full conversations and trash-talking each other in full sentences in the Western version, and that Kirby's personality comes off as a lot more sarcastic and confrontational. This differs greatly from other Kirby games, where Kirby hardly speaks at all and is also much friendlier in general, as Arle and Carbuncle were in the Japanese version.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>卡比魔法气泡</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/6765\">HAL研究所</a>、<a href=\"/person/32942\">コンパイル</a>、<a href=\"/person/7587\">BANPRESTO</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/6734\">任天堂</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Kirby's Ghost Trap</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>星之卡比大雪崩</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>卡比的崩落气泡</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii VC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995年2月1日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"crt":[{"id":14680,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/aa/39/14680_crt_2ZC6C.jpg","name":"卡比","desc":"主角"}],"staff":[{"id":6765,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/63/42/6765_prsn_uZVUv.jpg","name":"HAL研究所有限公司","desc":"开发"},{"id":32942,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5a/9e/32942_prsn_MIk3k.jpg","name":"Compile","desc":"开发"},{"id":7587,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/5e/4d/7587_prsn_KGneK.jpg","name":"万普","desc":"开发"},{"id":6734,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/6f/d9/6734_prsn_ygMvd.jpg","name":"任天堂","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":83226,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/8e/b6/83226_1Pp11.jpg","title":"Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/83226"},{"id":300296,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/87/84/300296_8fZFF.jpg","title":"ぷよぷよ","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/300296"}]}
