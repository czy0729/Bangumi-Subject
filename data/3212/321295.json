It was the first in the trilogy surrounding the Dark Savant, which was followed by Wizardry VII: Crusaders of the Dark Savant and Wizardry 8. It was developed by Sir-Tech Software, Inc. and was released on the Amiga and DOS platforms in 1990 by the same company, and for the Super Famicom in Japan in 1995 by ASCII.\r\n\r\nAlthough based upon previous games in the series, David Bradley completely rewrote the system for this release. This was the first game in the series to feature full color graphics. The game was mouse-driven and ran with EGA graphics. It was also one of the few games in the Wizardry series that would not allow characters to be imported from previous games. The character creation and level-up process was more detailed than in previous releases. The player can choose from eleven races and fourteen professions. There are multiple skills divided into three categories, and magic is divided into six schools. Combat also allowed several different options, such as thrust or bash, depending on the weapon selected.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry_VI:_Bane_of_the_Cosmic_Forge","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>巫术VI：禁断的魔笔</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/40315\">Sir-Tech</a> Software</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/40315\">Sir-Tech</a> Software、Gamepot Inc.</li><li><span>别名: </span>Wizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>巫术6：宇宙熔炉之灾</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>巫术VI：创世神笔之诅咒</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>巫術VI：創世神筆之詛咒</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC (DOS)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>J-3100</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FM Towns</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC-98</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Amiga</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1990年1月2日</li><li><span>剧本: </span>David W.
