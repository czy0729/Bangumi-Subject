It stars Glen Powell, Jack Black, Zachary Levi and Josh Wiggins. Parts of the film, which was shot in live-action, will be animated using a technique similar to the rotoscoping used in Linklater's Waking Life (2001) and A Scanner Darkly (2006). The film takes place during the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing and will explore children on Earth's fantasies about the event. Apollo 10½ premiered at South by Southwest on March 13, 2022, and is scheduled to premiere on Netflix on April 1, 2022.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>阿波罗10½号：太空时代的冒险</li><li><span>别名: </span>Apollo 10½</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2022年4月1日</li><li><span>片长: </span>98分钟</li>","collection":{"on_hold":2,"dropped":1,"wish":4,"collect":10,"doing":0},"tags":[{"name":"2022","count":6},{"name":"美国","count":4},{"name":"Netflix","count":3},{"name":"欧美","count":3},{"name":"剧场版","count":3},{"name":"原创","count":3},{"name":"电影","count":2},{"name":"科幻","count":2},{"name":"剧场版-02","count":1},{"name":"WEB","count":1},{"name":"动画电影","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":1124830,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1124830","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":1,"desc":""}]}
