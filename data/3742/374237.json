It stars Glen Powell, Jack Black, Zachary Levi and Josh Wiggins. Parts of the film, which was shot in live-action, will be animated using a technique similar to the rotoscoping used in Linklater's Waking Life (2001) and A Scanner Darkly (2006). The film takes place during the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing and will explore children on Earth's fantasies about the event. Apollo 10½ premiered at South by Southwest on March 13, 2022, and is scheduled to premiere on Netflix on April 1, 2022.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>阿波罗10½号：太空时代的冒险</li><li><span>别名: </span>Apollo 10½</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2022</li>","collection":{"on_hold":0,"dropped":0,"wish":0,"collect":3,"doing":0},"tags":[{"name":"2022","count":1}]}
