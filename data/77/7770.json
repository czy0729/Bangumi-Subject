They turn to their unofficial consultant, Sherlock Holmes, who deduces various elements pointing to a serial killer. Meanwhile, Holmes is introduced to John Watson, and the pair immediately move into a flat in Baker Street. After a series of incidents, the person responsible for the deaths, a taxicab driver, reveals that his victims took their own lives by playing a game of Russian roulette with two pills: one fatally poisonous, the other safe. Watson shoots the "cabbie", who reveals as he dies that Moriarty masterminded the entire plan.

He discovers that symbols spray-painted onto an office wall are a coded message intended for an employee of the bank, who is later discovered dead in his flat. The next day, a journalist is killed and the same symbols are found nearby. Holmes and Watson follow a trail of clues that link the two dead men to a Chinese smuggling ring, who are trying to retrieve a valuable item that one of them stole. Holmes eventually cracks the coded message based on Suzhou numerals and a book cipher, but not before Watson and a female friend are kidnapped by the Chinese crooks. Holmes rescues Watson's friend but the leader of the gang escapes. After escaping, the leader of gang is in communication with her superior, who is identified by the initial "M".She is then shot by a sniper.

After apparently rejecting the case, Sherlock begins to be taunted by a sinister criminal who puts his victims into explosive vests and sets Sherlock deadlines to solve apparently unrelated cases, including the disappearance of a businessman, the death of a TV personality and the death of a guard of an art gallery. An assassin the Golem  is featured in the plot. As Sherlock solves the cases, he realises that they are all linked. After clearing up the case of the civil servant that Mycroft offered him, Sherlock tries to force his unseen adversary to reveal himself. The show ends with a tense stand-off between Sherlock and his nemesis Moriarty, who reveals himself as the consulting criminal who arranged the crimes that Sherlock has had to solve.
