The protagonist, Anton, had recently moved there with his family and was almost immediately forced to witness and participate in a chain of unsettling events.\r\nIt's a place where children go missing. The police are powerless, search teams are combing out the forest, but they find no traces. Why, then, is Anton repeatedly coming across prints, bloodstains, and scraps of clothing? It almost feels like someone is putting up a show just for him.\r\nHe is haunted by nightmares at first, which grow more and more frightening and bloody every night. They also grow increasingly real ... and beckoning.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>小兔子</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>视觉小说</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2020年03月19日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Saikono, RUzura Interactive</li><li><span>发行: </span>Mars People Games</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>store.steampowered.com/app/1249880</li>","collection":{"wish":1}}
