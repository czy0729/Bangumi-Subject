It is the seventh game in the Anno series, and returns to the use of a historical setting following the last two titles, Anno 2070 and Anno 2205, taking place during the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. Following the previous installment, the game returns to the series' traditional city-building and ocean combat mechanics, but introduces new aspects of gameplay, such as tourism, \"blue-printing\", and the effects of industrialisation influences on island inhabitants.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>纪元 1800</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/8105\">Ubisoft Entertainment</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/8105\">Ubisoft Entertainment</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>经营模拟</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019年4月15日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://anno-game.ubi.com/anno-1800</li>","collection":{"wish":15,"collect":33,"doing":4,"on_hold":2,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"Ubisoft","count":8},{"name":"PC","count":5},{"name":"SIM","count":5},{"name":"建造","count":2},{"name":"经营","count":2},{"name":"198","count":1},{"name":"视频通关","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":8105,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/0a/a5/8105_prsn_Ll0zI.jpg","name":"育碧娱乐","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":280535,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0e/6a/280535_q26M8.jpg","title":"Anno 1800 Original Game Soundtrack","type":"原声集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/280535"},{"id":137447,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/79/ed/137447_pIcsO.jpg","title":"Anno 2205","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/137447"}]}
