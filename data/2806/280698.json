Released to arcades in 1997, Mortal Kombat 4 is the first title from the series, and one of the first made by Midway overall, to use 3D computer graphics. It is also the last game of the series to have an arcade release. Eurocom (who had previously developed the Sega Saturn version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3) later ported it to the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, PC, and Game Boy Color during 1998. An updated version titled Mortal Kombat Gold was released exclusively for the Dreamcast the following year.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay system of Mortal Kombat 4 is similar to that of the previous games; one of the most notable additions is the use of weapons and objects during fights. The storyline chronicles the attack from the corrupted Elder God Shinnok against his former comrades who trapped him in the Netherealm many years prior to the beginning of the series. The other 17 playable characters take part in the battle between good and evil, with the forces of light trying to stop Shinnok and the forces of darkness from conquering all the realms.\r\n\r\nWhile developing the game, the Midway staff had problems making the graphics as it was one of the first 3D fighting games they developed. Co-creator Ed Boon commented that the staff wanted to make Mortal Kombat 4 more violent than its predecessors, removing the comical finishing moves featured in them. Since its release, the game received generally positive response from critics, with the exception of the Game Boy Color port.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>真人快打4</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/34482\">Digital Eclipse</a>、<a href=\"/person/34481\">Eurocom</a>、<a href=\"/person/32718\">Midway Games</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32718\">Midway Games</a></li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>October 15, 1997</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":34482,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b2/64/34482_prsn_RG7Mz.jpg","name":"Digital Eclipse","desc":"开发"},{"id":34481,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/c3/b6/34481_prsn_gsdgB.jpg","name":"Eurocom","desc":"开发"},{"id":32718,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/14/80/32718_prsn_HD7Yl.jpg","name":"Midway Games","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":79528,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c5/33/79528_HFo28.jpg","title":"Mortal Kombat III","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/79528"},{"id":280697,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/8e/00/280697_Uh3np.jpg","title":"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/280697"}]}
