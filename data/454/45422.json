The story deals with a political cover-up centred around a rogue batch of vaccine that seems to be causing a deadly virus, as well as the moral, social and privacy concerns of such a system in a post-7/7 world. The story is told through the eyes of a mathematical genius, Stephen Ezard, who is portrayed as a recluse and showing some signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The final episode then has a plot twist in which this apparent virus is shown to be in fact an ethnicity-specific side effect of an experiment in producing an internal, injected and unfakeable bio-tag, a side-effect, which affects Arabs, but not Caucasians, and so (to avoid international scandal) has had to be shut down.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>最后的敌人</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>日</li><li><span>集数: </span>5</li><li><span>开始: </span>2008-02-17</li><li><span>结束: </span>2008-03-16</li><li><span>类型: </span>Thriller/SF/Adventure/Mystery</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>频道: </span>BBC One</li><li><span>电视台: </span>BBC</li><li><span>视频制式: </span>PAL</li><li><span>首播国家: </span>英国</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0966151</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"悬疑","count":1},{"name":"Robert_Carlyle","count":1},{"name":"Anamaria_Marinca","count":1},{"name":"Iain_B._MacDonald","count":1},{"name":"Benedict_Cumberbatch","count":1},{"name":"英剧","count":1},{"name":"Max_Beesley","count":1},{"name":"Magnus_Fiennes","count":1},{"name":"Peter_Berry","count":1},{"name":"BBC","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":188117,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/188117","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":188118,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/188118","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":188119,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/188119","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":188120,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/188120","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":188121,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/188121","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
