Enemies drop money and power-ups. The money can be used at Hot Dog stands to replenish health. A variety of items can be collected, each with a different effect. Fester and the rest of the Addams family are based on their characters from the popular 1960s TV show (this game was made before the remakes in both series and movie form).","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>福斯特的冒险</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/17913\">Sunsoft</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17913\">Sunsoft</a></li><li><span>音乐: </span><a href=\"/person/32929\">小高直樹</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>爱登斯家族</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Run and gun / Adventure</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1989年</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"TDS","count":1},{"name":"ARCADE","count":1},{"name":"FC","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":17913,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/3c/00/17913_prsn_tGoT3.jpg","name":"Sunsoft","desc":"开发"},{"id":32929,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/d3/e0/32929_prsn_qSqC0.jpg","name":"小高直树","desc":"音乐"}]}
