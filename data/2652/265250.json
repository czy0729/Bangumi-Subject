Players attempt to win by giving orders to a small squad of armed combatants, most commonly with the goal of eliminating all enemy units.\r\nThe game has online multiplayer, a single-player campaign, and a skirmish mode. The game and its soundtrack formed part of the Humble Frozen Synapse Bundle between 28 September 2011 and 12 October 2011, which ultimately grossed over $1 million and had over 230,000 downloads.\r\nIt is set in dystopian cyberpunk future, in which the player assumes the role of a tactical commander assisting a resistance faction in a struggle against a corporate government regime which has used its power to manipulate the populace, or is pitted against other commanders (human or AI) in a skirmish or multiplayer setting.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>冰封触点</li><li><span>别名: </span>凝神</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Turn-based tactics</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2011年5月26日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Mode 7 Games</li><li><span>发行: </span>Mode 7 Games</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"普通游戏","count":1},{"name":"超短期","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":126311,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ee/a7/126311_Hs67i.jpg","title":"Frozen Synapse Prime","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/126311"}]}
