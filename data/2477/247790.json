The game is expected to be released for Microsoft Windows in early 2018.\r\nDauntless was heavily inspired, as well as frequently compared to, Capcom's Monster Hunter series, which can see hundreds of hours put into a game by a player. The game is intended to be played co-operatively as they see it as a social experience, and intend to add social/multiplayer interactions that are persistent in games like World of Warcraft and Destiny to differentiate Dauntless from the Monster Hunter games.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>无畏</li><li><span>平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ARPG</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unreal Engine 4</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019年5月21日</li><li><span>售价: </span>Free</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://playdauntless.com/</li>","collection":{"collect":4,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"共斗","count":1},{"name":"PS4","count":1},{"name":"ARPG","count":1}]}
