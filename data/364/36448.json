Unfortunately the tyrannical widow for whom he works forces the woman to marry the drunkard Kapiton Klimov in the mistaken belief that she would achieve his redemption. No such transformation occurs and she is sent off to distant lands, leaving Gerasim broken hearted. He finds consolation when he saves the puppy Mumu from drowning and forges a relationship to fill the void left by Tatiana. When the widow takes an initial shine to the puppy, the brute promptly bites her and Gerasim suffers another loss.　","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>木木</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>别名: </span>Mumu</li><li><span>原作: </span>Ivan Turgenev</li><li><span>导演: </span>Valentin Karavayev</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Valentin Karavayev</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">编剧: </span>Aleksandr Kostinskiy</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1987</li><li><span>片长: </span>18min</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>苏联</li><li><span>语言: </span>俄语</li><li><span>IMDb链接: </span>tt2296863</li>","collection":{"wish":12,"collect":4,"on_hold":2,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":3},{"name":"俄国","count":3},{"name":"现实主义","count":2},{"name":"中庸","count":1},{"name":"人X狗","count":1},{"name":"屠格涅夫","count":1},{"name":"外國","count":1},{"name":"木木","count":1},{"name":"Valentin_Karavayev","count":1},{"name":"剧场版","count":1},{"name":"小说改","count":1},{"name":"小说衍生","count":1},{"name":"Youtube","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":912958,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/912958","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
