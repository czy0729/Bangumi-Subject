{"id":282888,"type":4,"name":"Virtual Bart","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e5/5f/282888_raJaa.jpg","summary":"Bart's reality goes virtual when he is strapped into Martin Prince's Virtual Reality experiment at the elementary school science fair. Each virtual reality program represents a stage in the game that Bart must play through in order to escape the machine before the programs crash.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three side-scrolling platform stages and three stages that take place from a rear view. Bart assumes the roles of a pig, dinosaur, and baby for the platform stages. He tosses tomatoes and eggs, slides down a water slide, and drives a motorcycle in a post-apocalyptic Springfield for the three remaining stages. They are all accessed by chance via a wheel-of-misfortune.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>辛普森家庭 - 巴特的幻想</li><li><span>发行: </span>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</li><li><span>开发: </span>Sculptured Software</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"MD","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}]}
