To your superiors, you're nothing but cannon fodder... \r\nThe open world approach lets you define your own path and story in the campaign. Push back the enemy with your comrades or go deep behind enemy lines to sabotage their efforts and loot valuable items. \r\n\r\nAs you gain experience, you are promoted with higher command over soldiers and equipment. Call in artillery fire missions or paratrooper reinforcements when the situation gets tight! Use your squad to man armed boats, tanks and APC's, or, become the expert lone wolf you always aspired to be - it's up to you!","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>小兵步枪</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Top-down shooter</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2015年4月2日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.modulaatio.com/runningwithrifles/</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":22,"doing":3,"on_hold":1,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":10},{"name":"TPS","count":5},{"name":"独立游戏","count":3},{"name":"战争","count":2},{"name":"STEAM","count":2},{"name":"横版","count":2},{"name":"视频通关","count":1},{"name":"FPS","count":1},{"name":"STG","count":1}]}
