It was released on November 15, 2005 in North America, November 18 in the PAL region, and November 23 in Japan. It is a 2D platform game, but Sonic's and Blaze's sprites are rendered in 3D, creating a 2.5D effect. Boss battles, along with a Sonic-exclusive special stage, are entirely 3D. The game's storyline follows the intertwining adventures of a new character, Blaze the Cat, and the series' main character, Sonic the Hedgehog. They respectively battle Doctor Eggman and his doppelgänger Eggman Nega at certain points throughout the game. This is a Rumble Pak game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series.\r\nThe game was announced under the working title Sonic DS at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004, and under Sonic Rush at E3 2005. The game's 2.5D format was based on Sonic Team's idea to combine elements from 2D and 3D games in the series. Upon release, Sonic Rush was well received by critics, with praise stemming from the game's music and similarity to older games in the series and criticism stemming from its overall quickness. A sequel, Sonic Rush Adventure, was later created and released in 2007.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>索尼克衝刺</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32714\">ディンプス</a>、<a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Nintendo DS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform, action</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1-2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2005-11-15（北美)</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://sonic.sega.jp/rush/</li><li><span>开发者: </span>Sonic Team, Dimps</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":14,"doing":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"SEGA","count":2}],"crt":[{"id":75332,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/79/48/75332_crt_d04ZO.jpg","name":"索尼克","desc":"金丸淳一"}],"staff":[{"id":32714,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/91/52/32714_prsn_bbeQn.jpg","name":"Dimps","desc":"开发"},{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":208,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/09/1d/208_aus.jpg","title":"Sonic Rush Adventure","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/208"}],"like":[{"id":1558,"name":"心灵传说","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/29/92/1558_teTA8.jpg"},{"id":130,"name":"雷顿教授与不可思议的小镇","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9b/86/130_S6sjz.jpg"},{"id":129,"name":"雷顿教授与恶魔之箱","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d1/f4/129_XnQE2.jpg"},{"id":271,"name":"押忍！战斗！应援团","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/7f/10/271_K22Wd.jpg"},{"id":954,"name":"雷顿教授与最后的时间旅行","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/63/95/954_ajp.jpg"},{"id":316,"name":"燃烧吧！热血旋律魂 押忍！战斗！应援团2","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3f/e9/316_gwpqW.jpg"},{"id":269,"name":"摸摸瓦里奥制造","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/06/13/269_3F4F4.jpg"},{"id":939,"name":"逆转裁判：复苏的逆转","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3d/f1/939_D2Xa7.jpg"}]}
