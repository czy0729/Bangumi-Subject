The game was one of the nine launch titles offered when the Atari 2600 went on sale in September 1977.\r\n\r\nThe player's objective is to solve basic arithmetic problems. Game variations determine whether the player solves addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems, and whether he/she could select the top number (the console randomly selects the lower number).\r\n\r\nThe player uses the joystick to enter an answer to the math problem. The game uses sound effects to signal whether the answer is right or wrong.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Fun With Numbers</li><li><span>平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Educational（益智）</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1977年9月11日</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Gary Palmer</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
