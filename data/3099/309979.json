You must shoot an outlaw that suddenly appears somewhere in the town displayed on the screen. You must draw your gun as soon as he draws his and then you must shoot him before he shoots you in order to score points. Players can select one of two characters: Half-fast Pete or Billy-The-Kid. Pete is more accurate while Billy can draw faster. Certain numbers of hits are needed to achieve the end-of-game ratings such as \"Dude\", \"Greenhorn\" and \"Top Gun\".","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Sears: Gunslinger</li><li><span>平台: </span>街机</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1976年3月</li><li><span>其他发行日期: </span>1978年6月 (Atari 2600)</li><li><span>程序: </span>David Crane</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
