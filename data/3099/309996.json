The game was one of the nine launch titles available when the Atari 2600 went on sale in September 1977. The objective is identical to the card game: to beat the dealer's card total, without going over 21, to win a bet. One to three players play the computer dealer.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>程序: </span><a href=\"/person/39073\">Bob Whitehead</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Atari 400/800</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~3人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1977年9月11日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"},{"id":39073,"image":"","name":"Bob Whitehead","desc":"程序"}]}
