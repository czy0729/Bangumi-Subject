Henry is in denial of his own obvious feelings towards Eliza, while also doubting that Eliza has any real feelings towards him. Henry decides that the risk is worth it to pursue a relationship with Eliza, but backs off after talking to a drunk Freddy at an office party. Henry wonders if a fear of commitment is why Eliza dumped Freddy and is pursuing him instead. Eliza is insulted by this theory, and tells Henry that she can see through his own relationship with Julia and how he is not in love with her. Julia, who was going to surprise Henry at the party, overhears and exits. Henry claims to be following after her, causing Eliza to revert to her party girl mentality, drinking heavily and ending up in bed with Freddy again.
