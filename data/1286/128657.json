The game quickly heats up as Shredder, Tiger Claw and a new army of mutants threaten the streets of New York, forcing Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo to take action into their own hands. The game’s distinguishing feature is its vast, interconnected, non-linear game world, which rewards exploration and creative thinking. Powers, upgrades and equipment scattered across New York and Dimension X opens up new environments to traverse, secrets to discover and bosses to battle. \r\n\r\nAll four Turtles can be swapped between freely throughout the adventure, and each has his own unique rhythm, with specialized stats, strengths and skills. Combat is fast-paced, emphasizing the gang’s martial arts prowess through attack and item combos, counters and finishers, but also provides tools for stealth-based approaches to avoid or tackle enemies. \r\n","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>忍者神龟：危机泄露</li><li><span>平台: </span>3DS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox360</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2014年10月28日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$39.99</li><li><span>发行: </span>Activision</li><li><span>开发: </span>WayForward Technologies</li>","collection":{"collect":2}}
