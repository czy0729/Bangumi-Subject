It is the last TMNT game to be made by Konami.\r\n\r\nIt is the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game that is rated E10+ by the ESRB. Although it was released in 2005, when the 2003 TV series was in its fourth Season, the game was based on the third season. The game is divided into four sections, called \"Episodes\" (one is unlocked at the third Episode's conclusion): Space Invaders, dealing with the third season opening arcs Space Invaders and Worlds Collide; Bishop's Gambit, based on both the eponymous episode of the third season, and featuring antagonists from two other episodes; Exodus, detailing the events of New Blood and the Exodus two-parter; and finally The Nightmare, based on the five episodes in which Ultimate Drako separated the Turtles and Splinter across different dimensions.\r\n","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>忍者神龟3：突变噩梦</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NDS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人/多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2005年11月01日</li><li><span>开发: </span>KONAMI</li><li><span>发行: </span>KONAMI</li>","collection":{"collect":4,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PS2","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":128697,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9f/8f/128697_Myc8B.jpg","title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/128697"}]}
