An improvisatory romance which gingerly deports itself between 1890's Chicago and 1980's small town Michigan, the reader is helped along by thousands of colored illustrations and diagrams, which, when read rapidly in sequence, provide a convincing illusion of life and movement. The bulk of the work is supported by fold-out instructions, an index, paper cut-outs, and a brief apology, all of which concrete to form a rich portrait of a man stunted by a paralyzing fear of being disliked.","info":"<li><span>作者: </span><a href=\"/person/17940\">Chris Ware</a></li><li><span>出版社: </span>Pantheon</li><li><span>价格: </span>$19.95</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2003-04-29</li><li><span>页数: </span>380</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>0375714545</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"另类","count":1},{"name":"graphicnovel","count":1},{"name":"校园凌霸","count":1},{"name":"美漫","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":17940,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/44/48/17940_prsn_eX79x.jpg","name":"Chris Ware","desc":"作者"}]}
