To perform stronger punches or kicks, the player must hold the directional pad towards the opponent while pressing either attack buttons. The third button is used for taunting. Some of the stages in the game feature destroyable scenery that gives the player and their opponent access to new areas in the stage. As well as their special moves, each character has a 'killer' attack which is only accessible when they are close to death and the red part of the characters' life gauge at the top starts flashing. This is done by pressing the Taunt button in conjunction with a specific D-Pad motion. These moves nearly take out the other characters life gauge completely.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>忍者神龟：格斗大会</li><li><span>别名: </span>激龟快打MD版</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年12月10日</li><li><span>开发: </span>KONAMI</li><li><span>发行: </span>KONAMI</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":5},"tags":[{"name":"FTG","count":3},{"name":"1993","count":1},{"name":"MD","count":1},{"name":"FC","count":1},{"name":"Konami","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":85709,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/97/ea/85709_W54c0.jpg","title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/85709"},{"id":128695,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4e/2f/128695_f3K06.jpg","title":"ティーンエイジ・ミュータント・ニンジャ・タートルズ：ミュータント・ウォーリアーズ","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/128695"}]}
