In Last Man Standing, the goal is to be the last living player. Knock Out challenges the player to KO the most players in a set time or to reach a set amount of KO first. King of the Hill's goal is to get to a set amount of points before the other players. To gain points, players must stand in the light beam that moves to set places on the map. Finally, the goal of Keep Away is to carry a chest to gain points. While carrying the chest, players are unable to attack. The carrier must run away from the other players because being hit will cause the carrier to drop the chest.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>忍者神龟：变种格斗</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人 / 多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2005年03月15日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Konami</li><li><span>发行: </span>Konami</li>","collection":{"collect":5},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":2}]}
