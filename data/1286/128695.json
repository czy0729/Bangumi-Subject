The Turtles decide to participate in order to stop their nemesis as well as proving their strength in the tournament. At the same time Karai kidnaps April O'Neil and Splinter.\r\n\r\nThis game's controls uses a four-button scheme (two punches and two kicks, weak and strong). A particular feature is the possibility to use a super special attack. In order to achieve this, the player must fill a green bar under the life bar, by hitting their opponents. Once full, the player must press the two strong attack buttons simultaneously. There is also the option of enhancing the speed of the game, making the fights more intense but also harder to follow.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>忍者神龟格斗</li><li><span>别名: </span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Warriors</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters</li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FTG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年12月03日</li><li><span>开发: </span>KONAMI</li><li><span>发行: </span>KONAMI</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"relations":[{"id":85709,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/97/ea/85709_W54c0.jpg","title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/85709"},{"id":128691,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/8f/b2/128691_qQtqJ.jpg","title":"T.M.N.T. トーナメントファイターズ","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/128691"}]}
