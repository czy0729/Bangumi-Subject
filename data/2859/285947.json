But when Royce's mother is killed, Catherine finds herself implicated in a string of murders. While trying to prove her innocence, Catherine is tasked with investigating a human trafficking operation linked to the serial killings. Meanwhile, senior HMIT officers Detective Superintendent Andy Shepard (Vincent Franklin) and Detective Inspector Jodie Shackleton (Katherine Kelly) begin to suspect that the supposed fourth victim of the serial killer, Victoria Fleming (Amelia Bullmore), was in fact murdered by someone else. Gradually their investigation starts to lead them towards Victoria's actual killer – police detective John Wadsworth (Kevin Doyle), whom Fleming had been blackmailing. Catherine's grandson, Ryan, develops a friendship with a new teaching assistant, Miss Wealand (Shirley Henderson), who is secretly a prison groupie infatuated with Royce. Royce, whom the court has forbidden having any contact with Ryan, is using Wealand to try to build a relationship with Ryan and get revenge on Catherine. Ryan increasingly concerns his family by asking questions about his father and even suggests Royce should be forgiven.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>幸福谷 第二季</li><li><span>别名: </span>快活谷</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>欢乐谷</li><li><span>集数: </span>6</li><li><span>开始: </span>2016-02-09</li><li><span>结束: </span>2016-03-15</li><li><span>类型: </span>剧情 / 悬疑 / 犯罪</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>60min</li><li><span>电视网: </span>BBC</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt4371366</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"BBC","count":1},{"name":"英剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":895147,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/895147","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":895148,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/895148","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":895149,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/895149","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":895150,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/895150","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":895151,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/895151","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":895152,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/895152","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":285946,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0b/41/285946_iSzeE.jpg","title":"Happy Valley Season 1","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/285946"}]}
