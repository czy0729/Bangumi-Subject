Cawood is now divorced from her husband and living with her sister, Clare (Siobhan Finneran), a recovering alcoholic and heroin addict, who is helping her bring up Becky's young son, Ryan (Rhys Connah), the product of rape. Neither Catherine's ex-husband nor their adult son, Daniel, want anything to do with Ryan. Catherine hears that Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton), the man responsible for the brutal rape that impregnated Becky and drove her to suicide shortly after Ryan was born, is out of prison after serving eight years for drug charges. Catherine soon becomes obsessed with finding Royce, unaware that he is involved in the kidnapping of Ann Gallagher (Charlie Murphy), a plot instigated by Kevin Weatherill (Steve Pemberton) and orchestrated by Ashley Cowgill (Joe Armstrong). Things quickly take a dark turn as the abductors scramble to keep the kidnapping secret, although Catherine is on to them.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>幸福谷 第一季</li><li><span>别名: </span>欢乐谷</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>快活谷</li><li><span>集数: </span>6</li><li><span>开始: </span>2014-04-29</li><li><span>结束: </span>2014-06-03</li><li><span>类型: </span>剧情 / 悬疑 / 犯罪</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>60min</li><li><span>电视网: </span>BBC</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt3428912</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"BBC","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":895141,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/895141","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":895142,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/895142","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":895143,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/895143","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":895144,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/895144","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":895145,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/895145","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":895146,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/895146","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":285947,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c8/67/285947_pcpHP.jpg","title":"Happy Valley Season 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/285947"}]}
