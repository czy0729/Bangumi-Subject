The game debuted in 1999, 10 years after the original, and incorporated 3D graphics in its gameplay.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, a Sega Dreamcast version under the name Prince of Persia: Arabian Nights was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Mattel Interactive, which had previously purchased both Red Orb Entertainment and The Learning Company. Many of the control flaws from the original PC version were corrected and other notable bugs were fixed, improving the gameplay of this port, although it still suffers the same camera problems. This version was only released in North America.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>波斯王子3D</li><li><span>平台: </span>Microsoft Windows Dreamcast</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Action Adventure</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>NetImmerse</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>Windows NA August 31, 1999 PAL October, 1999 Dreamcast NA December 6, 2000</li><li><span>开发: </span>Red Orb Entertainment (PC) Avalanche Software</li><li><span>发行: </span>The Learning Company (PC) Mattel Interactive (Dreamcast)</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":4},"tags":[{"name":"波斯王子","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1}]}
