The shareware version was released for the PC on May 13, 1997, while the full version was released on September 12, 1997. Shadow Warrior was developed using Ken Silverman's Build engine and improved on 3D Realms' previous Build engine game, Duke Nukem 3D. Mark Adams ported Shadow Warrior to Mac OS in August 1997.\r\n\r\nThe game's improvements included introduction of true room-over-room situations, the use of 3D voxels instead of 2D sprites for weapons and usable inventory items, transparent water, climbable ladders, and assorted vehicles to drive (some armed with weapons). Although violent, the game had its own sense of humor and contained some sexual themes. A combination of Shadow Warrior and Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition was published by GT Interactive Software in March 1998, titled East Meets West.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, 3D Realms released the source code for Shadow Warrior (including compiled Build engine object code) under the GPL, which resulted in the first source port a day later on April 2, 2005.[5] In 2013, Devolver Digital announced the game would be free to obtain for a limited time on Steam. Later, Devolver Digital announced that they would permanently offer the game for free.\r\n\r\nA remake, also titled Shadow Warrior, was developed by Flying Wild Hog and published by Devolver Digital, launched on September 26, 2013.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>影子武士</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/40109\">3D Realms</a>, General Arcade (Classic Redux)</li><li><span>发行: </span>GT Interactive (<a href=\"/person/17916\">Atari, Inc</a>), <a href=\"/person/30830\">Devolver Digital</a> (Classic Redux)</li><li><span>别名: </span>Shadow Warrior Classic Redux</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>影子武士：经典回归</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>影武者</li><li><span>平台: </span>MS-DOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Microsoft Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>OS X</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Build</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1997年9月12日</li>","staff":[{"id":40109,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/12/47/40109_prsn_c6hmU.jpg","name":"3D Realms","desc":"开发"},{"id":30830,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/e1/7b/30830_prsn_a3eQm.jpg","name":"Devolver Digital","desc":"发行"},{"id":17916,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/57/6a/17916_prsn_FZygZ.jpg","name":"雅达利公司","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":86529,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/75/35/86529_90pSe.jpg","title":"Shadow Warrior","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/86529"}]}
