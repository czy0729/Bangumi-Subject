She meets Teo, a fellow program participant and finds herself on the outs with Natalie, who bullies her because she is hearing. John and Kathryn inform the family of John's plans to run for state senate. Elsewhere, Toby embarks on a romance with Nikki, but pulls back after Emmett shows him a distasteful picture of her on the internet. Angelo tells Regina about his possible unborn child and Regina has a run-in with Lana, the other woman, in the elevator. Daphne opens up her food truck for business, but is uncomfortable with the decisions that John is trying to make for her.

Daphne takes it in stride and is supportive of Regina, suggesting a spa weekend just for the two of them, paid for from her food truck profits. Bay finds herself on the wrong end of Natalie's wrath, forcing Melody to take everyone on a Tolerance Retreat to help bridge the divide between them. Bay bonds with Noah, who confides to her that he has Meniere's Disease, has already lost 60% of the hearing in his right ear, and is in the Pilot Program at Carlton so that he can learn to sign before he loses the rest of his hearing. Regina finds out from her new doctor that she has osteonecrosis in her right wrist/hand and can never sign, paint or be a hairdresser ever again, which leads to a falling-out with Melody, who thinks Regina is faking to get sympathy. Daphne tells Noah how upset she feels about her mom not being able to sign with her anymore, and asks him can he imagine losing the ability to communicate with someone, but Noah passes on the opportunity to tell Daphne that he has Meniere's Disease. However, he helps her understand her mother's point of view and stop being angry at her. After the retreat when they are back at school, Bay and Natalie declare a truce. Also, Emmett is jealous of Bay's friendship with Noah and says he (Emmett) can't be friends with Bay anymore because it hurts too much to not be with her. Meanwhile, Kathryn possibly hurts John's campaign during a radio interview by mentioning John's views on [legal] immigration, which John's political enemies use against him by claiming he is for illegal immigration. John believes he can win by staying away from specific issues and keeping it very general before the election, and tells Kathryn to keep quiet about political issues from now on. Toby bonds with Lana and finds out that she is planning to give up her and Angelo's baby for adoption, as she is in medical school and has no local family (they're all in Boston). Toby points out that she does have local family, his sister, Bay, who is also the baby's sister.\r\n\r\nTitle reference: From the 1636 painting, Duel of Two Women, by Jusepe de Ribera.","status":"Air"},{"id":285394,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285394","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Dressing for the Charade","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-01-28","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285395,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285395","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"The Acquired Inability to Escape","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-02-04","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285396,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285396","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Human/Need/Desire","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-02-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285397,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285397","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Drive in the Knife","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-02-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285398,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285398","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Tight Rope Walker","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-02-25","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285399,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285399","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Uprising","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-03-04","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285400,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285400","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Introducing the Miracle","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-03-11","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285401,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285401","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"Mother and Child Divided","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-06-10","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285402,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285402","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"Distorted House","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-06-17","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285403,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285403","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"The Good Samaritan","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-06-24","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285404,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285404","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"He Did What He Wanted","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-07-01","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285405,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285405","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"Ecce Mono","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-07-08","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285406,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285406","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-07-15","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285407,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285407","type":0,"sort":17,"name":"Prudence, Avarice, Lust, Justice, Anger","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-07-22","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285408,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285408","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"As The Shadows Deepened","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-07-29","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285409,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285409","type":0,"sort":19,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-08-05","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":285410,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/285410","type":0,"sort":20,"name":"Family Secrets in Plain View","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2013-08-12","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":76053,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a7/0d/76053_ScNPy.jpg","title":"Switched At Birth (Season 1)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/76053"},{"id":98178,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/92/28/98178_B5Q3w.jpg","title":"Switched At Birth (Season 3)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/98178"}]}
