First released in June 2008 as a free Source engine mod, the game was entirely remade between 2009 and 2011 for a commercial release in February 2012. The game does not follow traditional video game conventions, as it involves minimal interaction from the player and does not require choices to be made nor tasks to be completed. It instead places focus on its story, which is told through a fragmented, epistolary narrative as the player explores an unnamed island in the Hebrides.\r\nThe status of Dear Esther as a video game has been contested by reviewers, but the game nonetheless received a positive critical reception following its release on February 14, 2012.\r\n(via wiki)","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>亲爱的艾丝特</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/19050\">The Chinese Room</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Dear Esther: Landmark Edition</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>亲爱的艾斯特</li><li><span>平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Source</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2012年2月14日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$9.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://dear-esther.com/</li>","collection":{"wish":13,"collect":12,"doing":2,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":6},{"name":"冷","count":2},{"name":"步行模拟","count":2},{"name":"PS4","count":1},{"name":"2012","count":1},{"name":"游戏","count":1},{"name":"AVG","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":19050,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ab/c0/19050_prsn_niagG.jpg","name":"The Chinese Room","desc":"开发"}]}
