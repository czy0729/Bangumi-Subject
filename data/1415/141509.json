Does not Commute is a temporal paradox in which you have no one to blame but yourself. What starts out as a relaxing commute in a small town of the 1970's quickly devolves into traffic chaos with hot dog trucks, sports cars, school buses and dozens of other vehicles. You drive them all. Plan ahead. Don't be late.\r\n\r\nIn this small town, discover the characters and their secrets – what world-changing experiment is inventive dentist Dr Charles Schneider hiding? Will Mr Baker quit his job in advertising? What is that strange mask on Mrs Griffin's face? Will Mr Mayfield’s peculiar obsession with Yorkshire Terriers take over his life?\r\n\r\nDoes Not Commute is playable at no cost and free from ads. An optional premium upgrade is available through a one-time in-app purchase that will enable the ability to continue from c*********s.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>拒绝上班</li><li><span>平台: </span>Android</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>休闲</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.mediocre.se/commute/</li>","collection":{"collect":14,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"IOS","count":4},{"name":"技术不好内购都过不去","count":1},{"name":"操作难度很高","count":1},{"name":"PUZ","count":1}]}
