So it is with great relish that for the second season, we are going to take the series into the realm of women, love potions and poisons.”","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>凡尔赛 第二季</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>星期一</li><li><span>集数: </span>10</li><li><span>开始: </span>2017-03-27</li><li><span>结束: </span>2017-04-24</li><li><span>类型: </span>历史</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>法国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语 / 法语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>50分钟</li><li><span>电视台: </span>CANAL+</li><li><span>首播国家: </span>法国</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://versailles.canalplus.fr/</li><li><span>Wikipedia: </span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versailles_(TV_series)</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":12,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"法剧","count":5},{"name":"2017","count":3},{"name":"英剧","count":3},{"name":"凡尔赛","count":2},{"name":"第二季","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":710964,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/710964","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"The Labyrinth","name_cn":"","duration":"00:55:00","airdate":"2017-03-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":710965,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/710965","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"A Still Small Voice","name_cn":"","duration":"00:54:19","airdate":"2017-03-27","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":710966,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/710966","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Who Will Guard the Guards Themselves?","name_cn":"","duration":"00:52:24","airdate":"2017-04-03","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":710967,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/710967","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Miasma","name_cn":"","duration":"00:51:56","airdate":"2017-04-03","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":710968,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/710968","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"War and Peace","name_cn":"","duration":"00:55:34","airdate":"2017-04-10","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":710969,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/710969","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"The Sands of Time","name_cn":"","duration":"00:52:51","airdate":"2017-04-10","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":710970,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/710970","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"A Night","name_cn":"","duration":"00:53:41","airdate":"2017-04-17","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":710971,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/710971","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"The New Regime","name_cn":"","duration":"00:52:30","airdate":"2017-04-17","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":710972,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/710972","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Seven Shadows","name_cn":"","duration":"00:53:32","airdate":"2017-04-24","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":710973,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/710973","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Of Blood and Stone","name_cn":"","duration":"00:54:09","airdate":"2017-04-24","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":180945,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9c/17/180945_0vv68.jpg","title":"Versailles Season 1","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/180945"},{"id":217518,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6d/ba/217518_749d4.jpg","title":"Versailles Season 3","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/217518"}]}
