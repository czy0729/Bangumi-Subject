The game stars an anthropomorphic cartoon star who uses his hands and long, stretchable arms to both move and combat enemies. Reception for the game has been generally positive, but the game's initial release was overshadowed due to the imminent ending of the Genesis's lifecycle and the succession of the Sega Saturn and other fifth generation video game consoles.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>外星王子</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Ristar</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995年2月17日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"Platform","count":1},{"name":"MD","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"开发"}]}
