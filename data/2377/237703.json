The player is in control of four special forces units who must enter an area and kill all enemies in it. The player plans the actions of all characters in advance and the turns are resolved simultaneously. It was released for iOS on July 17, 2013 and for Android on September 5, 2013. The game was ported to Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux, and was released through Steam on March 21, 2014. A PlayStation Vita version was released the following year.\r\n\r\nOn May 3, 2014, the Frozen Synapse DLC Pack was released for PC, featuring levels inspired by and designed like Frozen Synapse. Unlike the main game, which takes place in real-world places, the DLC missions take place in a manifestation of the cyberspace. Following a publishing deal for the games sequel, Breach & Clear: Deadline, the game was acquired by Gambitious Digital Entertainment and Devolver Digital in early 2015. The sequel was released on July 21, 2015. Deadline leaves the notion of real-world simulation behind by adding zombies to the game.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>火线突破</li><li><span>别名: </span>突破行动</li><li><span>平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Android</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PSV</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Turn-based strategy</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unity</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2013年7月17日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Mighty Rabbit Studios</li><li><span>发行: </span>Gun Media</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"2018","count":1}]}
