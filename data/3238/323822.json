After a life of abuse at their hands, she's in a new town, and looking for a fresh start.\r\n\r\nWhen she finally lands her first job, it's because a mysterious woman named Unit 01 granted it to her on the spot, for seemingly no reason. But whether she deserves it or not, it'll keep her and her roommate Killie housed and fed. So she takes it up.\r\n\r\nThen...she stumbles upon the shop's humongous underground lab, learns about the lonely situation of an energetic and very sweet girl named Unit 03, and somehow manages to avoid learning that she, along with the three others who live there, are all androids with no memory of how or why they were created.\r\n\r\nAs she learns more and more about their problems, her desire to help them grows greater and greater. She wants more than anything to see her new friends alive, happy, and together with her...\r\n\r\n...But what can a weak shut-in like her do?","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS X</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ADV 视觉小说</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Ren'Py</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2020年9月4日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$2.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://seedsewingcircle.com/spare-parts/</li><li><span>开发: </span>Sophie Rose</li><li><span>发行: </span>Sophie Rose</li>"}
