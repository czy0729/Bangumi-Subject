It was originally planned to be released as a commercial expansion pack to Return to Castle Wolfenstein and later as a standalone game. However, due to problems with the single-player aspect, the multiplayer portion was released on 29 May 2003 as a freeware standalone game. In January 2004, the source code for the game logic (not the game engine) was released to the benefit of its modding community.\r\n\r\nThe game uses a modified Return to Castle Wolfenstein engine, itself being a heavily modified id Tech 3 engine, which has been open source since 2005. As of the first day of the August 2010 QuakeCon, the entire source code was released under the GNU General Public License v3. The media assets remain proprietary.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>重返德军总部：深入敌后</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32568\">Splash Damage</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17518\">Activision</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>德军总部：敌区</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003年5月29日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.splashdamage.com/games/wolfenstein-enemy-territory/</li>","staff":[{"id":32568,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a8/17/32568_prsn_cklSk.jpg","name":"Splash Damage","desc":"开发"},{"id":17518,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/cb/6c/17518_prsn_bBbhR.jpg","name":"动视","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":146726,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b8/58/146726_3hxX3.jpg","title":"Enemy Territory: Quake Wars","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/146726"},{"id":81503,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d8/35/81503_eMvV4.jpg","title":"Return to Castle Wolfenstein","type":"主线故事","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/81503"}]}
