CAPCOM カードファイターズ2 EXPAND EDITION","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/56/98/260356_7HXND.jpg","summary":"This Japan-only sequel to SVC: Card Fighters' Clash was released in 2001 for the Neo Geo Pocket Color after Capcom vs. SNK 2. In addition to the 240 character and 60 action cards from the first game, 124 new cards are added, adding cast from Garou: Mark of the Wolves, Samurai Shodown: Warriors Rage, The King of Fighters '99 and 2000 for SNK, and Project Justice, Mega Man Legends, Dino Crisis and Onimusha for Capcom, while also including 40 Reaction cards similar that can be used during the opponent's attack. Another new feature is special character cards with alternate versions of various characters depicted with regular artwork instead of the super deformed style. Instead of being released as two versions (SNK and Capcom), this game was released as a single version that lets the players decide to either start with a SNK deck or a Capcom deck. It was the last game to be released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color in Japan.\r\nIn 2008, an English translation of the game titled as Card Fighters' Clash 2 (CFC2) was released in the form of a fan translation patch to the original game file. This project is aimed at bringing the second Card Fighters' Clash game to a wider audience.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>SNK vs.Capcom：卡片战士2 扩展版</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/705\">SNK</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/705\">SNK</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters 2 Expand Edition</li><li><span>平台: </span>Neo Geo Pocket Color</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Collectible card game</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1～2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2001年9月13日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"crt":[{"id":5108,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/86/cb/5108_crt_248X2.jpg","name":"隆","desc":"主角"},{"id":10321,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ec/45/10321_crt_aBxIM.jpg","name":"春丽","desc":"主角"}],"staff":[{"id":705,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a5/82/705_prsn_o7m1w.jpg","name":"SNK","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":260355,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c3/1b/260355_F695o.jpg","title":"SNK VS.
