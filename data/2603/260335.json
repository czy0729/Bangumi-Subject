The game was praised for its use of the first-person perspective for storytelling. In 2018 Microsoft had announced it would be available via backwards compatibility on the Xbox One via the physical disc and a digital download on the Xbox Live Store.\r\nAlthough Breakdown is a first-person action game, it integrates elements of a fighting game and uses auto-lock for shooting enemies. The viewpoint is always the player's, and interaction with objects is realistic: ammunition is picked up by looking down and grabbing it (instead of walking over it), doors are opened by grabbing the handle, key cards used by swiping them over a scanner and ladders climbed by using one's arms. Health and energy are replenished by consuming energy bars, hamburgers, and sodas.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>神拳对决</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1598\">Namco</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Breakdown</li><li><span>平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AAVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2004年1月29日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":1598,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9c/19/1598_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"南梦宫","desc":"开发"}]}
