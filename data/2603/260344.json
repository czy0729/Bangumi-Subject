It was released in 2003 for the GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 video game consoles.\r\nThe game allows the player to build a school of gladiators and take them into battle against opposing schools in a quest for fame and glory. The plot focuses on several of the main characters and slowly affects the decisions of the group, eventually leading to a final large battle that tests the skills of all members of the school. Upon starting the game, the player can choose between a school in Imperia, home to a strong military mentality and soldiers who consider their northern neighbors uncivilized and bullish, or a school in Nordagh, where witches and woodland beasts dwell, and who in turn detest the Imperials for their desire for greater conquest.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>神鬼战士</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/32894\">LucasArts</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/32894\">LucasArts</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>帝国骄雄</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PSN</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SRPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003年10月28日</li>","staff":[{"id":32894,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/68/8b/32894_prsn_2pRjR.jpg","name":"LucasArts","desc":"开发"}]}
