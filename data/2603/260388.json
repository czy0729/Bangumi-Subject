Its unique feature is that the armies used are all created by the player. The armies consist of 9 creatures; each one is a combination of any two animals from a list of 76 (51 with no downloads). Many animals possess inherent abilities to add more strategic depth to the game. There is an extensive single-player campaign as well as online multiplayer functionality with different game modes, add-ons, custom maps, mods, and scenarios.\r\nImpossible Creatures was followed up later by a free downloadable expansion entitled Insect Invasion which added new creatures and abilities to the game. The last official add on for Impossible Creatures was released in 2004.\r\nOn November 12, 2015, Impossible Creatures was released on Steam as Impossible Creatures: Steam Edition, by THQ Nordic. Relic Entertainment and Sega relinquished the rights of Impossible Creatures to THQ Nordic after it was revealed that THQ nor Microsoft Studios owned the rights to the video game.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>不可思议的生物</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/16563\">Relic Entertainment</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/16859\">Xbox Game Studios</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>怪兽岛</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Impossible Creatures Steam Edition</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RTS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 6人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2003年1月7日</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":16563,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/09/4a/16563_prsn_D2d2d.jpg","name":"遗迹娱乐","desc":"开发"},{"id":16859,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/cd/16859_prsn_48aP4.jpg","name":"Xbox游戏工作室","desc":"发行"}]}
