On your mission you will progress from level to level shooting bad cowboys, jail-breakers, and bad Indians with your revolver; collecting bullets, dynamites, sheriff stars, and other useful items; running, jumping, ducking, and climbing. The locations vary from Forts, Towns, and Jails to Mines, Train, and Saloon with Ghosts. On every level you have to complete different submissions to progress – either to free a Bank Director, or to collect Three Nuggets for Miner to obtain a Nitroglycerine, or to build a Totem for Apaches, etc. At the end of some levels you confront the big boss, it is often the one of Daltons.\r\nDifferent arcade sequences between levels allow you to chase the Dalton brothers or train riding your faithful horse Jolly; to run away from Tornado; and to ride on the raft. \r\nBonus level arcade sequences represent your wrestling challenge with Jolly, bottles shooting, or revolver's barrel roulette.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>幸运卢克</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/31007\">Infogrames</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>SFC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Run and gun</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1997年10月27日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Infogrames</li>","staff":[{"id":31007,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/d1/54/31007_prsn_eWW9M.jpg","name":"Infogrames","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":85876,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/af/fa/85876_HRYUZ.jpg","title":"Lucky Luke","type":"动画","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/85876"}]}
