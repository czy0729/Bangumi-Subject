Released in November 1997 in North America and in February 1998 in Europe, the game was published by Bungie in North America and by Eidos Interactive in Europe. At the time, Bungie was known primarily as developers of Mac games, and The Fallen Lords was the first game they had developed and released simultaneously for both PC and Mac. It is the first game in the Myth series, which also includes a sequel, Myth II: Soulblighter, set sixty years after the events of the first game, also developed by Bungie, and a prequel, Myth III: The Wolf Age, set one thousand years prior to the events depicted in The Fallen Lords, and developed by MumboJumbo.\r\n\r\nThe game tells the story of the battle between the forces of the \"Light\" and those of the \"Dark\" for control of an unnamed mythical land. The Dark are led by Balor and a group of lieutenants (the titular Fallen Lords), whilst the Light are led by \"The Nine\"; powerful sorcerers known as \"Avatara\", chief amongst whom is Alric. The game begins in the seventeenth year of the war in the West, some fifty years since the rise of Balor, with the forces of Light on the brink of defeat; almost the entire land is under the dominion of the Dark, with only one major city and a few smaller towns remaining under the control of the Light. The plot follows the activities of \"The Legion\", an elite unit in the army of the Light, as they attempt to turn back the tide and defeat Balor.\r\n\r\nThe Fallen Lords received positive reviews from critics, and is credited as a defining title in the fledgling real-time tactics genre. Reviewers praised its plot, graphics, gameplay, level design, online multiplayer mode, and differentiation from traditional real-time strategy games. The most often criticized aspects were the difficulty of the single-player campaign, which many reviewers felt was far too high, even on the lowest setting, and some awkwardness in controlling units. The game went on to win multiple awards, including \"Strategy Game of the Year\" from both PC Gamer and Computer Gaming World, and \"Game of the Year\" from both Computer Games Strategy Plus and Macworld. It was also a commercial success, selling over 350,000 units worldwide across both systems, earning back roughly seven times its budget. At the time, it was Bungie's most successful game, and served to bring them to the attention of PC gamers and, more specifically, Microsoft, who would purchase the company in 2000.\r\n\r\nThe Myth series as a whole, and Soulblighter in particular, supported an active online community for over a decade after the official servers went offline. The first formally organized group of volunteer-programmers was MythDevelopers, who were given access to the game's source code by Bungie. The most recently active Myth development group is Project Magma, an offshoot of MythDevelopers. These groups have worked to provide ongoing technical support for the games, update them to newer operating systems, fix bugs, release unofficial patches, create mods, and maintain online servers for multiplayer gaming.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>神话：堕落之神</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/18353\">Bungie</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/18353\">Bungie</a>、<a href=\"/person/17043\">Eidos Interactive</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Microsoft Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Real-time tactics</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1997年11月7日</li>","staff":[{"id":18353,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/24/49/18353_prsn_i2hyK.jpg","name":"Bungie","desc":"开发"},{"id":17043,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/3c/71/17043_prsn_U3DbI.jpg","name":"艺夺","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":334521,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/13/a7/334521_Y1BzR.jpg","title":"Myth II: Soulblighter","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/334521"}]}
