The game was released on October 15, 1996 and included more levels than its predecessor Marathon 2: Durandal. These were larger, and formed part of a more intricate plot that spanned both space and time. Marathon Infinity, unlike Marathon 2, was originally released only for the Apple Macintosh. However, Bungie released the source for Marathon 2 in 1999, allowing the development of the open-source Aleph One engine. In 2005, Bungie released the trilogy to the public as freeware, allowing the games to be freely downloaded. In 2011, Bungie released the source code for Marathon Infinity itself.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>马拉松：无限</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/18353\">Bungie</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/18353\">Bungie</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Macintosh</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1996年10月15日</li>","staff":[{"id":18353,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/24/49/18353_prsn_i2hyK.jpg","name":"Bungie","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":334517,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/dd/0d/334517_58BJ7.jpg","title":"Marathon 2: Durandal","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/334517"}]}
