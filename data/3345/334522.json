The Wolf Age is the third game in the Myth series, following 1997's Myth: The Fallen Lords and 1998's Myth II: Soulblighter, both of which were developed by Bungie. In 1999, Take-Two purchased 19.9% of Bungie's shares, but when Microsoft bought Bungie outright in 2000, the rights for Oni and the Myth series were transferred to Take-Two, who hired the startup company MumboJumbo to develop Myth III.\r\n\r\nThe Wolf Age is a prequel to the two previous games, and is set one-thousand years prior to the events depicted in The Fallen Lords. It tells the story of Connacht's attempts to rid the land of the flesh eating monsters known as the Myrkridia, and defeat the immortal evil spirit \"The Leveler\", who has inhabited the body of the hero who defeated him in a previous age, Tireces. Now known as Moagim, The Leveler is determined to wipe out humanity. The plot of the game serves as an origin story for many of the main antagonists from The Fallen Lords and Soulblighter, and depicts the original forms and relationships of characters such as Balor, Soulblighter, Shiver, The Deceiver, The Watcher, and \"The Head\".\r\n\r\nThe game received generally positive reviews, although it was considered inferior to the two previous games. Critics praised the storyline, graphics, single-player campaign and general gameplay. Major points of criticism included the many bugs in the Windows version, awkward controls, and a poor online multiplayer mode. Many critics felt the game was rushed to release, with several speculating that MumboJumbo had not been given enough time to complete it satisfactorily. Shortly after the game was released, the entire development team was let go by MumboJumbo, and no further technical support or patches were provided by either MumboJumbo or Take-Two.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>神话3：苍狼世纪</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/33820\">Take-Two Interactive</a>、<a href=\"/person/41641\">Gathering of Developers</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>神话III：苍狼世纪</li><li><span>平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Real-time tactics</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2001年11月2日</li><li><span>开发: </span>MumboJumbo</li>","staff":[{"id":41641,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/c6/e6/41641_prsn_25DOr.jpg","name":"Gathering of Developers","desc":"发行"},{"id":33820,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/60/66/33820_prsn_65822.jpg","name":"Take-Two Interactive","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":334521,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/13/a7/334521_Y1BzR.jpg","title":"Myth II: Soulblighter","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/334521"}]}
