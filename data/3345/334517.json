It was released on November 24, 1995. The game is mostly set on the fictional planet of Lh'owon, homeworld of the S'pht, and once again the player takes the role of a Security Officer from the Marathon. This is the only game in the series to be released for Windows 95 in addition to the Apple Macintosh, and is the only one released for the Xbox 360. Unofficially, the open-source Aleph One engine enables the game to be played on many other platforms. This is legal as Bungie released the original game materials to the public in 2005, and Aleph One can employ them unaltered.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>马拉松2：杜兰达</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/18353\">Bungie</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/18353\">Bungie</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Macintosh</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Pippin</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人，多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1995年11月24日</li>","staff":[{"id":18353,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/24/49/18353_prsn_i2hyK.jpg","name":"Bungie","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":334516,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/df/a3/334516_1iAqq.jpg","title":"Marathon","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/334516"},{"id":334518,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d0/c3/334518_e8V6k.jpg","title":"Marathon Infinity","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/334518"}]}
