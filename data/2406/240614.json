Rumour has it that the government built the schools on cheap land such as graveyards, which quickly became the talk of the town in many prefectures.\r\n\r\nWitness one such school which is home to the Tenome, a Japanese yokai with eyes on its palms and feeds on the fresh bones of humans. See through the eyes of Tanaka; a bullied, asthmatic student who has been locked inside of the school at night.\r\n\r\nTenome is inspired by Hideyuki Hirayama's Gakkō no Kaidan.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2017年12月19日</li><li><span>制作: </span>Nyar</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
