Kelley打造，获得奥斯卡奖的笑星Robin Williams（罗宾·威廉姆斯）和曾经的「吸血鬼猎人巴菲」Sarah Michelle Gellar主演。该项目去年八月就被CBS买下，期间经过一番波折才正式成为试映集（并最终成为剧集）。Robin Williams不仅在电影界口碑极佳，在电视喜剧界也颇有建树。事实上当代多镜头情景喜剧的拍摄模式就是他三十年前主演的电视喜剧《Mork & Mindy》缔造的——在那部喜剧之前，多镜头情景喜剧一般采用三台固定摄像机进行拍摄。那部剧集为改善镜头效果增加了第四台摄像机，其他剧组纷纷效仿并沿用至今。 \r\n\r\n在这部单镜头办公室喜剧中，Robin Williams扮演具有传奇色彩的天才广告人Simon Roberts，他反传统的思维方式和不可预料的行为模式随时可能导致他被炒鱿鱼……如果他自己不是老板的话。他亲手缔造的广告公司掌握着世界上最重要的客户和品牌，但更重要的一点——他的女儿Sydney（Sarah Michelle Gellar）始终在他身边帮助他、支持他。 \r\n\r\n\r\n作为父亲的合伙人，Sydney和他的性格截然相反——她做事专注、务实、有条理，渴望凭自己的努力来获得成功。虽然她是公司的「生命和灵魂」，但她不得不花大量的时间来照顾稀里糊涂的父亲……好像他变成了她的儿子似的！要不是父亲如此聪明，在事业上的成就如此辉煌，Sydney肯定会恨他…… \r\n\r\n除了他们父女之外，其他员工对公司同样功不可没。英俊帅气、精力充沛的广告文案撰写人Zach Cropper（James Wolk）是个才华横溢的小伙子；艺术总监Andrew（Hamish Linklater）工作起来比谁都努力（同时比谁都神经质，这大概因为他暗恋Sydney的缘故）；高级助理Lauren（Amanda Setton）美貌性感，看上去十分聪明……但也只是「看上去」而已。 \r\n\r\n有了这么好的一个团队，Simon继续在广告界呼风唤雨、引爆激情——无论这群疯狂的人卖什么东西，总会有人被他们迷住，心甘情愿地掏钱包！ \r\n\r\nRobin Williams称这个剧名源自多年前苹果公司的一则广告，当时的广告词是「Here’s to the crazy ones.」当时这则广告与任何产品都无关，他们只是推销一种创新的理念——这部剧集正好描述的是这种理念。当一种新的理念被实践的时候，可能需要一点疯狂才行。","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>疯狂广告人</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>星期四</li><li><span>别名: </span>疯人疯语</li><li><span>集数: </span>22</li><li><span>开始: </span>2013-09-26</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>美国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>频道: </span>CBS</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.cbs.com/shows/the-crazy-ones</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2710104</li><li><span>wikipedia: </span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crazy_Ones</li>","collection":{"collect":14,"doing":7,"on_hold":2,"dropped":5},"tags":[{"name":"美剧","count":8},{"name":"喜剧","count":4},{"name":"2013年9月","count":3},{"name":"贵圈真乱","count":1},{"name":"CBS","count":1},{"name":"基","count":1},{"name":"广告","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":322552,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/322552","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"Pilot","name_cn":"","duration":"00:19:58","airdate":"2013-09-26","comment":0,"desc":"Simon Roberts must pull out all the stops and convince Grammy Award-winner Kelly Clarkson to record a new twist on a classic advertising jingle for their biggest client, McDonald's.","status":"Air"},{"id":322553,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/322553","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"The Spectacular","name_cn":"","duration":"00:20:23","airdate":"2013-10-03","comment":0,"desc":"Andrew is jealous of Zach's relationship with Simon, as he believes Zach is favored in the company.
