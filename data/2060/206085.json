It is designed to be an uncompromising, fast, tough and satisfying driving experience, soaked in that vertigo that stands at the core of the arcade racing genre. The floating system and driving models are based on physics: each turn, slope, hard braking, acceleration, each turn and twist of the track will apply a unique force to the ship. A sharp low-polygon style blends meshes and terrains with the latest state-of-the-art shading and lighting effects provided by the Unreal Engine 4, creating beautiful and instantly recognisable aesthetics. Breezy coastlines, eerie frozen landscapes, vast desert plains: the melancholic, dystopian atmosphere of a semi abandoned Earth is the background for the most high-speed, tense and beautiful futuristic racing clashes.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span>34BigThings</li><li><span>发行: </span>34BigThings</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">发行: </span>Nicalis</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">发行: </span>505 Games</li><li><span>别名: </span>Redout: Lightspeed Edition</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Redout: Enhanced Edition</li><li><span>平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS4</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RAC</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unreal Engine 4</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1-12人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2016年9月2日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$39,99/￥100</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://34bigthings.com/press/sheet.php?p=redout</li>","collection":{"collect":7,"on_hold":1,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"VR","count":1},{"name":"PS4","count":1},{"name":"RAC","count":1}]}
