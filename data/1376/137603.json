Here, now, in English for the very first time, as the debut release in Fantagraphics Books' ambitious manga line of graphic novels, are ten of the very best of these tales.\r\n\r\nThe work in A Drunken Dream and Other Stories spans Hagio's entire career, from 1970's \"Bianca\" to 2007's \"The Willow Tree,\" and includes the mind-bending, full-color title story; the famously heartbreaking \"Iguana Girl\"; and the haunting \"The Child Who Comes Home\" — as well as \"Autumn Journey,\" \"Girl on Porch With Puppy,\" the eerie conjoined-twins shocker \"Hanshin: Half-God,\" \"Angel Mimic,\" and one of the saddest of all romance stories, \"Marié, Ten Years Later.\"\r\n\r\nA Drunken Dream and Other Stories is supplemented with a feature-length interview with Hagio, where she discusses her art, her career, and her life with the same combination of wit, candor and warmth that radiates from every panel of her comics.\r\n\r\nList:\r\nThe Magnificent forty-niners by Matt Thorn\r\nThe Moto Hagio Interview\r\nBianka（ビアンカ　1970年）\r\nGirl On Porch With Puppy（ポーチで少女が子犬と　1971年）\r\nAutum n Journey（秋の旅　1971年）\r\nMarié.
