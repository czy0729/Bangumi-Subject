Like many detective games, this detective has not gotten any case for a long time. As a result, he just wonders aimlessly around the town flirting with a female in public library and helps Koume's Detective Club out to find the culprit of stealing her classmate's clothes. While these two events seemed irrelevant, it is a slow pavement behind a big evil (?!) scheme hidden in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this game, you will be switching between perspectives of the detective and his assistant.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>Lipstick Adventure EX</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Lipstick Adv.EX</li><li><span>平台: </span>WIN</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ADV</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1999-04-23</li><li><span>ブランド: </span>Fairytale</li><li><span>原画: </span>山本 浩憲</li><li><span>シナリオ: </span>野鳥 伸司</li><li><span>音楽: </span>Doors Music Entertainment</li>","collection":{"collect":2}}
