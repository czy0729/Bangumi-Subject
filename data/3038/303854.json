This establishes the humorous tone of subsequent narrative, which has little to do with history and a lot to do with pretty high school girls. The game has no real story, being instead composed of five unrelated vignettes, short episodes that feature a sexy high school girl, a male protagonist (named \"God\" by default), and various comical and erotic situations under different circumstances: meeting in a school, haunted house, crowded train station, etc.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/14782\">フェアリーテール</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC98</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>FM-TOWNS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>X68000</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ADV</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1991-07-26</li><li><span>ブランド: </span>フェアリーテール Ｘ指定</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"staff":[{"id":14782,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/ce/7f/14782_prsn_8xi9o.jpg","name":"妖精传说","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":303855,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/30/33/303855_d5NT9.jpg","title":"校内写生２","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/303855"}]}
