But when the grisly remains of local kids appear, he starts to suspect the new girl has something to do with it.  Soon Dillon realizes that an ancient, endless hunger has come to Carol Hill, Indiana in the form of a 10-year-old girl.  He and his classmates now have to stop Lilly's vicious, gore-drenched feast before it's too late.  But the secrets behind Lilly's rage might just be more terrifying than Lilly herself!","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>磨牙棒</li><li><span>出版社: </span>Antarctic Press</li><li><span>作者: </span>David Hutchison</li>","collection":{"doing":1}}
