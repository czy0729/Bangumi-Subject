There, he reunites with Lana Lang and her husband Kyle, while his sons befriend her daughter Sarah. While the twins mysteriously survive what should have been a fatal accident, the adults begin to suspect that Morgan Edge, already responsible for Clark's dismissal, has nefarious plans for Smallville. Clark's sons discover his spaceship, so he reveals that he is Superman and that at least one of them must have inherited his powers to have survived. While they initially assume the more athletic Jonathan is superpowered, it turns out to be the neuroatypical loner Jordan when he runs afoul of Sarah Cushing's boyfriend, Sean Smith. Meanwhile, Superman and General Sam Lane are dealing with a mysterious enemy who is sabotaging nuclear power plants so he can study how Superman uses his abilities. Superman loses a one-on-one fight with the man, who uses a powered exo-suit that conceals his identity via lead lining. In the end, Clark and Lois decide to move into the Kent farm to allow Jordan privacy as he grows into his powers. The mysterious enemy's name is revealed to be \"Captain Luthor\".","status":"Air"},{"id":1010891,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010891","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Heritage","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2021-03-02","comment":0,"desc":"While Captain Luthor searches the globe for Kryptonite, Clark takes Jordan to the Fortress of Solitude to meet a virtual version of Jor-El, who helps him learn Krypton's history. Meanwhile, at Smallville High, Jonathan is relentlessly bullied by Sean and his friends on the school's football team. Lois questions Edge at a city council meeting about his plans for Smallville. Tests at the Fortress reveal that Jordan's powers are temperamental and extremely limited, disappointing Clark. The Kents attend a barbecue at the Cushings' home, where Lois argues with Kyle over Edge's proposal. Luthor attacks General Lane at the Department of Defense and asks him to help destroy Superman before he can become a threat. General Lane reveals to Superman that he has been secretly stockpiling Kryptonite. After Edge turns her exposé on him into a puff piece, Lois quits the Daily Planet and joins the Smallville Gazette. At his base, Captain Luthor makes plans to build a new ship and armor while continuing to search for Kryptonite. A flashback to Luthor's world reveals that he is the last survivor of a military unit wiped out by an evil Superman.","status":"Air"},{"id":1010892,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010892","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"The Perks of Not Being a Wallflower","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2021-03-09","comment":0,"desc":"After being pushed around too many times by Sean and his friends, Jordan decides to push back by joining the team, gaining the respect of the coach and his new teammates. Clark is worried that doing so will reveal his powers, but Jonathan convinces him otherwise. Clark allows Jordan to join the team, and takes a job as the school's assistant coach. Sarah breaks up with Sean and quits the cheerleading team after an argument with her mother. However, Lana and Sarah eventually make up after the former reveals the dysfunctional state of their family like her father sleeping on the couch, Sophie picking on the kids in her class, and Lana abusing sleeping medication. Lois finds a woman named Sharon Powell to talk to regarding Morgan Edge's previous dealings that involved her son Derek. \"Subjekt-11\", a man with super-strength that rivals Superman's, ambushes Lois when she goes to meet with Sharon, but Superman saves them both. Subjekt-11 is later trying to leave town while asking Morgan on the phone what Larr's going to do to clean up the incident. Morgan's personal assistant Leslie Larr appears in the road and uses her heat vision to kill him. She calls up Morgan and tells him \"It's done. I'll call a team\".","status":"Air"},{"id":1010893,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010893","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Haywire","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2021-03-16","comment":0,"desc":"General Lane asks Clark to escort Thaddeus Killgrave, who is being transferred out of Metropolis Penitentiary due to Superman’s recent absence from the city. After Clark refuses to make an appearance in order to spend time with his family, Lane warns the twins not to distract their father from his role as Superman. Meanwhile, Lois asks Clark to show up to a town meeting to rally opposition to Edge's motion to re-open the local Shuster Mines. Superman gets tied up searching for Killgrave who was sprung out by Intergang, which results in Edge winning the mining vote. Meanwhile, Jonathan and Jordan's football teammate Tag Harris increasingly starts vibrating uncontrollably from his broken arm. The twins try unsuccessfully to help Tag, who is inadvertently becoming more and more dangerous. As Superman battles Killgrave, he hears Jonathan's ELT call for help, giving him added determination to quickly defeat Killgrave and come to the aid of his sons and Tag. Seeing that Clark is putting increased importance on his family, Lane initiates a contingency plan called Project 7734 inspired by the dog tag that Captain Luthor gave him.

Jonathan is upset as Eliza breaks up with him. As Jonathan acts out, from yelling at Clark about moving back to Smallville, to drinking at the Festival, Clark is reminded about the last Festival before he decided to move to Metropolis. Sharon comes back to the Smallville Gazette with her son Derek, who claims he was in a coma and had suffered from memory loss. Chrissy is immediately suspicious and tracks Derek after a fire breaks out at the Smallville Community Center (which Derek himself caused due to struggling with powers like Tag). Meanwhile, Captain Luthor introduces himself to Lois as Marcus Bridgewater and offers to help Lois with her investigation on Edge. Chrissy finds Derek with Larr, re-exposing him to X-Kryptonite radiation to stabilize his powers. Luthor tries to destroy both Derek and Superman, but both are unarmed. Derek then causes his body to overload with energy and disintegrate to avoid questioning. Lana presents a bench to the town that serves as a memorial to Martha. Luthor sees Lois happy with Clark and is reminded of the Lois on his world who was his wife. After a date at the Festival, Sarah and Jordan decide to remain as friends. As Jordan is walking home, he is ambushed by a super-powered Tag who wants to know what he did to him.","status":"Air"},{"id":1010895,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010895","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Broken Trust","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2021-05-18","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":1010896,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010896","type":0,"sort":7,"name":"Man of Steel","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2021-05-25","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":1010897,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010897","type":0,"sort":8,"name":"Holding the Wrench","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2021-06-01","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"NA"},{"id":1010898,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010898","type":0,"sort":9,"name":"Loyal Subjekts","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2021-06-08","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"NA"},{"id":1010899,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010899","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":1010900,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010900","type":0,"sort":11,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":1010901,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010901","type":0,"sort":12,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":1010902,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010902","type":0,"sort":13,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":1010903,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010903","type":0,"sort":14,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":1010904,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1010904","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
