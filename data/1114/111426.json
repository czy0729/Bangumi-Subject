The step-siblings bond while playing gin rummy, and Jared later comes home and joins them. Jon visits the wheelchair-ridden Foulkes to taunt and condemn him, explaining that he believes Foulkes is corrupt and somehow involved in George Melton's (falsely alleged) murder – during this confrontation he reveals that the statute of limitations on Hanna's rape, but not her murder, has expired – this casts doubt on Chris's confession to the rape and denial of the murder.
