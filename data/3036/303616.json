{"id":303616,"type":4,"name":"ロリータ２","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d4/45/303616_7747L.jpg","summary":"It is a very simple text-only adventure in which the protagonist must track young girls after school and have them perform various actions (a few of them of a remotely sexual nature). The sparse descriptions are in Japanese, but the text parser is English-only, recognizing the four directions (N, S, W and E) and a few basic commands such as \"Look\" and \"Use\". Much of the game is spent navigating the protagonist through the invisible, text-only maze by typing the directional commands. A few items must be found and used in order to complete the game.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC88</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1983-05</li>","collection":{"collect":2}}
