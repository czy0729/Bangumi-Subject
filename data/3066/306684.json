The underworld is not only filled with blood red lakes, needle forests and blazing infernos, but also the spirits of several celebrities and historical figures. Yes, during the course of your adventure, you’ll run into Napoleon Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler, John Wayne, John Lennon, Marilyn Monroe, Cleopatra, Ryoma Sakamoto (a famous samurai), and a figure who appears to be Jesus Christ but is addressed only as “senpai”. You’ll also meet up with Count Dracula, for some reason.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC88</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ADV</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1984-09</li><li><span>ブランド: </span>ハミングバードソフト</li>","collection":{"collect":2}}
