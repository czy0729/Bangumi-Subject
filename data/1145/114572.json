The player takes the role of an ex-MI6 agent named Jack Hunter, who is recruited by Auric Goldfinger (a member of a powerful unnamed criminal organisation based on Ian Fleming's SPECTRE) to assassinate his rival Dr. No. Several other characters from the Bond series make appearances throughout the game, including Pussy Galore, Oddjob, Xenia Onatopp and Francisco Scaramanga.\r\n\r\nDespite its name and being part of the James Bond universe, the game has no relation to the 1995 film or the 1997 video game of the same name. In this setting the game's protagonist is given the name 'GoldenEye' after he loses his eye and receives a gold-colored cybernetic replacement.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>黄金眼：黑帮情报员</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NDS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人/多人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2004年11月22日</li><li><span>发行: </span>EA</li><li><span>开发: </span>EA LA 、EA Tiburon & n-Space</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1,"dropped":1}}
