It is a modern reimagining of the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye, and a remake of the 1997 Nintendo 64 video game GoldenEye 007. The game was officially announced by Nintendo at their E3 2010 conference presentation. The game was released on November 2, 2010 in tandem with another James Bond game, Blood Stone. It took on the elements of a modern shooter while retaining a classic name. A remastering of the Wii game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in 2011, re-titled as GoldenEye 007: Reloaded.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>黄金眼007</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/17518\">Activision</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>GoldenEye 007: Reloaded</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>黄金眼007 重装上阵</li><li><span>平台: </span>Wii</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NDS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS3</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox360</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1-4人/联网4-8人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2010年11月02日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Eurocom 、 n-Space</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"crt":[{"id":68107,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/1b/16/68107_crt_P1opQ.jpg","name":"詹姆斯·邦德","desc":"Daniel Craig"}],"staff":[{"id":17518,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/cb/6c/17518_prsn_bBbhR.jpg","name":"动视","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":23700,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/bf/5e/23700_gwk64.jpg","title":"James Bond 007: Blood Stone","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/23700"},{"id":114569,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a3/65/114569_jlxX1.jpg","title":"GoldenEye 007","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/114569"}]}
