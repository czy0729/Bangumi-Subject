Berzerk places the player in a series of top-down, mazelike rooms containing armed robots.\r\n\r\nThe player controls a green stick man. Using a joystick and a firing button that activates a laser-style weapon, the player navigates a simple maze filled with many robots, who fire lasers back at the player character. A player can be killed by being shot, by running into a robot or an exploding robot, getting electrocuted by the electrified walls of the maze itself, or by being touched by the player's nemesis, Evil Otto.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>Vectrex</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 5200</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>街机</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1980年11月12日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Stern Electronics, Atari, Inc.
