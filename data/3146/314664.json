The game follows traditional volleyball rules; the first team to score 15 points wins! You control both players on the team, which have the ability to serve, set, spike, and block. There are several game variations included; two game difficulties and two player speeds. In the easier version of the game, the ball will automatically be sent back over the net when hit. In the advanced version, the game also allows you to set the ball between teammates. In either version of the game with either one or two players, the speed at which the players run can be set to either fast or slow for an extra challenge or to handicap one team.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>浏览器</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 2600</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1982年10月</li><li><span>程序: </span>Bob Polaro, Jim Huether</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
