Salmon Run was the first game in Williams's career, followed by a string of successes noted for their oddball concepts.\r\n\r\nThe player takes the role of Sam the Salmon, as he attempts to swim upriver to mate. Along the way he encounters waterfalls, a bear, fishermen and seagulls, all attempting to eat him. If he survives to the spawning grounds, he is met and kissed by his mate.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a> Program Exchange</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/38616\">Atari</a> Program Exchange, Showcase Software</li><li><span>平台: </span>VIC-20</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Atari 400/800</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1~4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1982年夏</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Bill Williams</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"staff":[{"id":38616,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/50/04/38616_prsn_iNezv.jpg","name":"雅达利（1972-1984）","desc":"开发"}]}
