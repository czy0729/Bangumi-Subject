It was released in 1993 and developed and published by Konami.\r\nBuster Bunny's mission in this game is to trace down and defeat Montana Max, who has stolen and hidden some treasure and rescue Babs Bunny. Many foes are in the way, including Roderick Rat and Gene Splicer, who has brainwashed several of Buster's friends, including Plucky Duck, Hamton J. Pig, Dizzy Devil and Calamity Coyote. Upon defeating Gene, the helmet controlling Buster's friends will fall off and explode, leaving them dazed or to fall down in a comical fashion (in the case of Calamity Coyote).\r\nTo complete each level, Buster must find Gogo Dodo, who will allow him to enter a portal. Additionally, Buster can find portals reminiscent of the show's rainbow-coloured logo, that will take Buster into Wackyland in the form of a bonus level. Here, Buster must attempt to collect as many items as he can before touching one of the numerous Dodos that populate the level.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>宾尼兔大冒险-隐藏的宝藏</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/747\">KONAMI</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>兔宝宝历险记之Buster的宝藏</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>宾尼兔冒险: 隐藏的宝藏</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993年2月7日</li>","collection":{"collect":3},"staff":[{"id":747,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/bb/c1/747_prsn_43cah.jpg","name":"科乐美","desc":"开发"}]}
