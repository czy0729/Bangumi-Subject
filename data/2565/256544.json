The Mega Drive version is a cut-down version.\r\nFlink is one of the few Amiga CD32 titles not to see a release for the Amiga home computer system, on which the CD32's hardware was based. The majority of titles released for the CD32 were essentially the versions developed for Amiga home computers, taking only minor advantage of the CD-ROM medium with extra levels, CD audio, and/or FMV sequences.\r\nThe creators, Erwin Kloibhofer and Henk Nieborg, were also responsible for the games The Adventures of Lomax and Lionheart.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>弗林克的冒险</li><li><span>别名: </span>The Misadventures of Flink</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>富林克的冒险</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>魔法王子</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>倒霉的弗林克</li><li><span>平台: </span>Amiga CD32</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mega-CD</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1994年</li><li><span>开发: </span>Psygnosis</li><li><span>发行: </span>Psygnosis</li>","collection":{"wish":1}}
