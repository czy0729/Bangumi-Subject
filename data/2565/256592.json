It was re-released via emulation services such as the Wii's Virtual Console and Microsoft Windows in 2010, and was also included in the North American version of Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable.\r\nIt is the second game in the Shinobi series released for the Mega Drive, following The Revenge of Shinobi. However, it is not a continuation of the previous game, but rather a loose adaptation to the 1989 arcade game Shadow Dancer. Like in the original arcade game, the player controls a ninja followed by a canine companion. The Secret of Shinobi was well received by critics.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>影武者：忍者之秘</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1541\">SEGA</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi</li><li><span>平台: </span>MD</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Wii VC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PSP</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ACT</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1990年12月1日</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"1990","count":1},{"name":"MD","count":1},{"name":"SEGA","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":1541,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/36/ff/1541_prsn_NI30h.jpg","name":"世嘉","desc":"开发"}],"relations":[{"id":79596,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/52/8d/79596_8zUce.jpg","title":"Shadow Dancer","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/79596"}]}
