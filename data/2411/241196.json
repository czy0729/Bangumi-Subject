When one of the lead scientists still on board tries to unriddle the possibility of a relaunch young Janitor Harold is around to assist her. Join Harold in his clumsy undertakings to stir up the ark-like ship’s stale day-to-day life and find the secrets that lie behind its doors.\r\n\r\nUnderwater atmosphere, self-reflective humor and contemporary adventure mechanics make up the foundation of this  game created entirely out of craft supplies.\r\n\r\nHarold Halibut started out as a dinner table conversation about the adventure games we played as children. We soon started building dollhouse sized sets and puppets in our bedrooms. The result works like a game but it looks like a stop motion film. Welded metal, carefully sewn textiles against tiny wooden floorboards and clay faces the size of walnuts pull the player into Harolds world.","info":"<li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/39364\">Curve Digital</a></li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>冒险</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://haroldhalibut.com</li>","collection":{"wish":2},"staff":[{"id":39364,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a7/33/39364_prsn_Ma3Pz.jpg","name":"Curve Digital","desc":"发行"}]}
