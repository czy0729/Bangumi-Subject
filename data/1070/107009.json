Out of the blue, The Machine gives Reese a new number for Ali Hasan (Navid Negahban), who has developed a covert communications network using old VHF television antennas laced throughout the five boroughs of New York, making it invisible to Samaritan. When one of Hasan's clients, a gang known as \"The Brotherhood\" forces Hasan to set up a network for them, Hasan plants a bomb in a burner cell phone he gives to one of the leaders, but Reese prevents the bombing. In response to the bombing, Hasan's son Ben is kidnapped by The Brotherhood, leading Reese to hire Elias and give him the largest heroin drug supply on the East Coast in exchange for helping to keep his NYPD cover clean and saving Hasan's son. Meanwhile, Samaritan agent Martine Rousseau (Cara Buono) arrives in New York to find anyone in the city that may be a threat to Samaritan's security. Harold and John meet in the park, where Harold gives him one of the phones which uses the invisible network Hasan had built, Hasan having decided to move his family elsewhere and start over. The Machine also sends a coded message to Harold through his cover's dissertation which leads him to a new underground hideout off of Decima's radar, using a forgotten Interborough Rapid Transit Company station. Reese is transferred to the 8th Precinct Homicide task force following his career drug bust and is assigned as Fusco's new partner, sitting at Carter's old desk.

But Claire is unaware that a private military firm from which she stole files for the game is after her to recover those documents. Several of their assassins are intercepted by Reese and Shaw just as they are about to kill Claire. Finch ultimately discovers that the Nautilus recruitment puzzle is being run by Samaritan. When Finch reaches out to her, warning against finishing the game, she does not listen and instead makes her way to the end of the game: the rooftop of a building in nautilus form. There, she is held at gunpoint by Silverpool operatives. Believing the game to be a lie, Claire hands over the documents, only to see the operatives are shot dead by unseen snipers. Before she can react, she discovers a phone on which Samaritan reveals its presence and recognizes her as an asset. Through Claire's documents, Silverpool's atrocities are exposed, as is a Silverpool threat identification program that would have competed with Samaritan.

Eventually, Fusco and Cooper are taken captive by some mob members and are locked into a shipping container with the expectation that the brutal heat in the city will kill them from heatstroke. Reese, Shaw and Bear come to their rescue and are able to bring the mob gang into their precinct headquarters. Precinct Captain Moreno (Monique Gabriela Curnen), who had been critical of Fusco and Reese earlier, congratulates them on their good work, while wondering about the signature technique of hitting the knees.

Despite Lee's prediction that Murray will be reelected, Murray loses, leaving Lee suspicious of the election result. Lee is proven right as the team discovers that the election upset is the result of vote rigging by Samaritan and that it wants Lee dead to tidy up loose ends. As Finch, Shaw, and Root try to determine Samaritan's endgame, Reese is scheduled to attend therapy sessions with a counselor because of his tendency to shoot people on the job. Initially, he tries to smooth-talk the therapist, who is not fooled. Elsewhere, Root reveals to Finch that since Samaritan's activation, The Machine ceased talking, leaving her without guidance and afraid. Following this revelation, Finch and Root debate the true nature of The Machine. They are interrupted when Samaritan operatives led by Martine find the hotel where Lee is hiding. Root offers to help Finch by protecting Simon as he escapes the hotel. Despite being shot several times by Martine in the process, Root manages to divert Samaritan's focus from the target. The next day, Finch and Shaw produce fake data to convince Lee that his prediction about the election was incorrect, causing Samaritan to disregard him. Reese tells his therapist why he feels compelled to save people, referring to his failure to save Carter. In the end, Greer and Martine discuss Samaritan's plans to gain political control, Samaritan instructs them to \"Find the machine\", and Finch indicates to The Machine his desire to communicate with it.

In the absence of Finch (who has to travel to Hong Kong to present a paper at a conference), Shaw and Reese look into Walter's life. As their investigation proceeds, it is revealed that Walter, posing as a detective, is trying to find out who killed Abel. Walter gets dragged into a gang war that erupts between Elias and the unknown adversaries who want Walter dead. It is later shown that Abel, without his knowledge, was smuggling high explosive weapons to the same gang in New York. Walter is abducted by the gang that wants to know the location of the truck which Abel drove and then ditched, once he realized what he was smuggling. With Reese, Fusco and Shaw hot on the heels of Walter, they discover the place where Walter is held. In the ensuing gunfight between Reese, Fusco and the gang, Elias joins in and helps them. In the end, Elias meets with Dominic, the boss of The Brotherhood and it is shown that Dominic was the real mastermind behind the smuggled guns as he wanted to shift the balance of power in the city from Elias. Their conversation hints at a possible war about to start between the two factions in the near future. Meanwhile, at the conference, Finch meets Elizabeth Bridges (Jessica Hecht), the owner of a small tech company, and the two bond over a shared interest in mathematics as they travel from the conference to a hotel.

At first, Tomas's life appears clean, but when he robs a jewelry store in under ten seconds, Finch and Shaw discover he is an international thief. As Shaw has just walked out of her old job as a wheelman, Tomas has piqued her interest. She enlists the help of Fusco and Reese to join his gang by getting one of his members arrested on a drug charge. Shaw, now on Tomas's team, helps them rob a safe, which unbeknownst to her and Tomas and the others, contains a deadly virus called Marburg, or \"MARV\". The other gang members were already aware and were paid off to betray Tomas and kill him. The attempt fails, however, the vials are stolen. Shaw offers to help Tomas, who wants to make things right and admits that he would never have accepted the job if he had known what he was stealing. After tracking the whereabouts of the virus, which is housed in a secure storage facility, Shaw realizes a couple of government operatives are doing the same thing—she identifies one of them as her former apprentice. Finch, now aware that the whole operation has become 'relevant', contemplates that he and his team resign from pursuing it any further, but he later changes his mind. In the meantime, Shaw and Tomas attempt to break into the storage facility to steal the vials, but they are confronted by a former teammate of Tomas, who was presumed dead, but was behind the theft of the virus in the first place. In the ensuing gunfight between Shaw, Tomas, his rivals, and the government operatives, Shaw manages to escape with Tomas and the vials, but then she gets caught by her former apprentice. Surprisingly, the operative lets them go when he sees the vials. As the government operatives move on to another mission, Shaw's apprentice deletes the CCTV video that shows him letting Shaw escape. In the end, Samaritan retrieves the damaged video, and starts repairing it, with its screen focused on Shaw's blurred face. Meanwhile, Root and Finch, at The Machine's prompting, investigate software engineer Jared Wilkins, founder of a new nonprofit called OTPS and recipient of a $12 million grant from Governor Dawson (who last appeared in \"Prophets\" and is being assisted by Greer and Samaritan). With Root disguised as Wilkins' son's nanny, Root and Finch discover that OTPS stands for One Tablet Per Student, an effort to give every New York student a 3D-printed tablet to assist in their education. Believing the tablets to be powered by Samaritan software, Root and Finch infiltrate Wilkins' facility and plant a virus which overheats the 3D-printers inside and ultimately destroys the building. As they leave the scene, Finch reveals to Root that the tablets' code was benign and not malicious.

The team learns that she is spying on her fellow recruits, though further analysis zaproves that Silva is not hunting them, but is instead already a cop from Internal Affairs, working undercover in the academy trying to expose a suspected mole. The mole is Silva's fellow recruit and friend, Alex Ortiz, who is acting on orders of the Brotherhood—he is being coerced by their leader, Dominic (whose identity Finch and Shaw work out while observing his sense of command) in exchange for help with his uncle's legal problems. Ortiz steals files proving Silva is a cop from Silva's handler and then murders him, framing Silva for the crime and making her a wanted fugitive. Ortiz also steals files from the academy's commandant for Dominic. Reese, Fusco and Silva go to Spanish Harlem where Ortiz is under fragile protection by a local drug cartel. The group retrieves Ortiz and escapes while Dominic has the cartel leader executed. Ortiz's confession exonerates Silva and improves Reese's standing in front of Internal Affairs. Meanwhile, Finch has scrutinized the elements of the case enough to formulate a conclusion: Dominic's target is Elias, their new number.

Martine, attempting to trace Root and Shaw, learns that Fusco had stopped the truck, officially on suspicion of narcotics possession. Pretending to be a DEA agent, Martine goes to the precinct station to question Fusco about it. Fusco sees through the ruse and gives her a false lead. Reese and Finch deal with their latest number alone—Elias. Elias and Dominic are playing a dangerous and deadly cat-and-mouse game for gang territory control. Elias, his right-hand man Anthony, and his accountant Bruce, turn out to have been devoted friends since their youth in an orphanage. Dominic gets many of Elias's people to turn on him in exchange for promises of expanded territory and power under The Brotherhood. Reese steps in to defend Elias and, during the process of evading Dominic, Anthony is captured and later killed in a suicide bombing, but not before putting some thoughts into the head of Link, Dominic's own right-hand man, about loyalty versus expendability. Before Anthony dies he says morior invictus (\"I die undefeated\"). Greer and Martine deduce that The Machine's team is still alive and that Samaritan has a \"blind spot\" somehow caused by The Machine. He reiterates that it is time for \"human intelligence\" to fill that blind spot—Martine is given command of a group of Decima agents to hunt down Shaw. Meanwhile, Dominic has deduced that there is an extra-legal team helping Elias—he has two of the players figured out (Shaw and Reese), with the bankroller's place (Harold) still a large question mark. Elias vows revenge for the death of Anthony, and warns Reese to stay out of the way once that day comes. Elias declares Invictus maneo (\"I remain undefeated\").\r\n\r\nDirected by Richard J.

Samaritan's actions leave Harold and his team with a difficult choice, whether to let Samaritan do their job or play along with Samaritan's new plan. When The Machine decides not to communicate with Samaritan, Samaritan changes course, bringing New York City to a halt as it allows crime to dramatically increase.

However, they are almost immediately intercepted by Samaritan operatives, who corner them in a room. Out of options, the team turns to The Machine, who in a matter of seconds provides a multitude of projections and outcomes in each (while doing so, it reflects on multiple chess matches it played and the lessons it learned with Finch in 2003). In one simulation, Finch and Root go to install the software while Reese and Fusco secure their escape route. However, both teams are quickly surrounded by Samaritan operatives, who kill Finch, Reese, and Fusco, forcing The Machine to reset the simulation. In the second, the two teams switch places (Reese and Fusco install the software while Finch and Root secure the route). Here, Reese and Fusco are once again trapped, and Reese sacrifices himself by setting off a grenade after installing the software. Likewise, Root is killed by Martine and her group of operatives while trying to disable an elevator lock. In a final simulation, all four of The Machine's assets move together, securing the software and the extraction. They are once again intercepted before they can escape, with The Machine projecting a roughly 2% chance of survival. Out of time, The Machine selects this as the most preferable and instructs the team to follow it. Meanwhile, Shaw is stuck on a subway train with a stock market exchange manager with a security code to the exchange's server room. However, she is interrupted by a would-be suicide bomber who she kills in the first two simulations (and thus gets herself arrested) but talks down in the final and ultimate outcome. After sending the code to Root, she arrives as the two teams clash, opting to hold the Samaritan operatives off as Finch, Reese, Fusco, and Root escape.

After an exchange with one of Samaritan's operatives, the operative instantly shuts down the government's access to Samaritan, forcing a discussion between the operative, Control, Senator Garrison, and Greer, which results in access being returned. Suspicious of Samaritan's actions, Control orders Brooks and Grice to make recovering the laptop their highest priority. When Brooks and Grice do obtain the laptop, Said escapes and the laptop self-destructs. An analysis of Said's backpack (which he left with the laptop) shows that Said is planning to hop a train to Canada, prompting Control to head to Detroit to intercept him. However, Reese and Root (who have been hunting for Shaw since her disappearance at the stock exchange) ambush and kidnap her. Root tortures Control for information on Shaw, but Control denies having knowledge regarding Shaw's predicament. When Harold speaks to her, he realizes that Control herself has been kept out of Samaritan's plans and tries to convince her to accept this fact, but to no avail. With no help from Control, Harold and the rest of the team are left to fight off a group of ISA operatives who have arrived to rescue her.

Harold tells the judge the (in-universe) truth about the government using technology to control our lives, and as he expects, he is initially rejected from the panel. He is brought into the jury panel anyway, after one empaneled juror is rejected by the judge because his phone rings. He is seated next to a chatty and frustrated former schoolteacher named Emma (Blair Brown), who turns out to be The Machine's next number. The team initially concludes that she is a perpetrator, being coerced to \"fix\" the trial, and that her role is to convince the jury to vote \"not guilty\". Once in the jury room, the opposite proves true—she is supposed to convince the jury to vote \"guilty\". Harold reverses himself and stalls to try to get a \"not guilty\" verdict and to buy time while Reese and Zoe Morgan try to deduce what the real story is. The jury is sequestered in a hotel, and one of the jurors attempts to kill Harold, but Reese intervenes and the man is arrested. The man is actually a plant by the real perpetrator, the new CEO of the company. The murder was to prevent the dead CEO from withdrawing a product worth many millions of dollars but which internal reviews deemed to be unsafe. The new developments lead to dismissal of charges, and the real perpetrator is arrested before he can flee. Fusco, who had been kept out of the loop for the most part, tells Reese not to do that. He says if he eventually dies in the line of duty (as Carter did and Shaw seemed to), then he's okay with it. Emma, feeling a new sense of purpose in her life, tells Harold she is going to find a job teaching again. Zoe sees that Reese has found a love interest—a growing attraction between himself and his counselor.\r\n\r\nDirected by Kate Woods\r\nWritten by David Slack","status":"Air"},{"id":454309,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/454309","type":0,"sort":15,"name":"Q&A","name_cn":"问答","duration":"00:43:48","airdate":"2015-02-17","comment":1,"desc":"Reese and Finch work to save the life of Anna Mueller, a software programmer at Fetch and Retrieve. They learn that she is being targeted because she expressed concern over the results VAL, a mobile app designed to aid users, is giving to people with depression that has resulted in suicides. However, Finch discovers a nautilus during the investigation and is contacted by Claire Mahoney who tries to convince him that he was right all along about the people who created the nautilus game. When Finch tells her about Samaritan, she tells him that she had recovered some source code from it and wants him to use it on his laptop, but he's suspicious. Claire reveals herself to be an agent working for Samaritan and leads Finch at gunpoint to a school run by Samaritan and attempts to recruit him, but he refuses. Root rescues him from the agents and shoots Claire, who later returns and hands Finch's laptop to Greer who has it analyzed. Back at Fetch and Retrieve, Calvin Mazer holds Fusco and Anna at gunpoint and reveals to them that he was the one who ordered that VAL's source code be altered to target people with depression, gambling problems and debt, for the sake of the advertisers. Reese rescues them, and Calvin is arrested by Fusco. The next day, Greer attends a board meeting at Fetch and Retrieve and greets the CEO, Lauren Buchanan, and offers them a solution to their problems.\r\n\r\nDirected by Stephen Semel\r\nWritten by Dan Dietz","status":"Air"},{"id":465481,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/465481","type":0,"sort":16,"name":"Blunt","name_cn":"","duration":"00:43:17","airdate":"2015-02-24","comment":3,"desc":"Reese works to save the life of Harper Rose (Annie Ilonzeh), a grifter who is targeted by Dominic after she steals a large amount of money from a legalized marijuana dispensary. Her actions result in two of Dominic's men who were acting as security in a money laundering operation being targeted and killed by the Parral Cartel who were tipped off by Harper. Enraged by her actions, Dominic tracks down her boyfriend, Trey, and interrogates him for information on Harper. Reese reaches out to Dominic and offers to return the money stolen by Harper in exchange for Trey and the hit being called off on Harper, but he's not interested and demands that Harper be handed over. In a face-to-face meeting in a diner, Dominic complains that Elias seems to get a pass. Reese tells him he and Elias stay out of each other's way, and that he and Dominic could also stay out of each other's way if Dominic stops targeting innocent people. Harper then decides to visit the Estonian mafia after suggesting the plan to Reese and Finch and tells them about Dominic's money laundering operation, and lures them to Dominic's location while Reese rescues Trey. Fusco and the NYPD arrive and arrest the Parral Cartel, initially on possessing weapons illegally. Dominic and his crew are quickly released when he produces legal documents that show the guns they are using are registered to his private security company. During the bust, Dominic attempts to recruit Harper while Reese watches on. She's not interested, but he leaves the door open for her if she changes her mind. Harper then apologizes to Trey for her actions, and also immediately breaks up with him. Meanwhile, Root tries to sell an application she developed at The Machine's request, which she hopes will aid in trying to defeat Samaritan.\r\n\r\nDirected by Frederick E. O.

The team determines that Edwards has been studying the people who traumatized his clients and got away with it, then carefully crafting frame-ups in order to punish them for their crimes. When Wyatt Morris (Daniel Sauli), the man convicted of murdering Edwards' wife is released from prison, Edwards stages his most elaborate frame: to commit suicide and make it appear that Morris murdered him. In flashbacks to 2010, Harold is shown plotting revenge on Alicia Corwin, whom he believes is responsible for killing his collaborator Nathan Ingram. As he is about to kill Corwin with a car bomb, he has an epiphany thanks to the intervention of The Machine. He uses that experience to persuade Edwards not to go through with his plan. Additionally, the team uncovers evidence that suggests Morris probably did not commit the crime. Harold and Reese discuss the fact that they may never know the full truth. In a session with his own therapist (Iris), Reese begins to open up about Jessica, the love of his life.\r\n\r\nDirected by Chris Fisher\r\nWritten by Hillary Benefiel & Sabir Pirzada","status":"Air"},{"id":475416,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/475416","type":0,"sort":18,"name":"Skip","name_cn":"跃","duration":"00:43:48","airdate":"2015-03-24","comment":6,"desc":"The team splits up and works on separate cases.

Finch resumes meeting with Elizabeth Bridges, who is nearly ready to turn over a software package that contains the Trojan Horse which Finch had installed previously. He intends to activate it via a special device. Root, fearing that this will result in Finch being exposed and killed by Samaritan agents, foils the plan, at the cost of Finch and Elizabeth's growing mutual attraction. A doubly devastated Finch tells her to leave the team for a while. Early in the episode, Iris tells Reese she cannot be his therapist anymore, and assigns him to another.

Finch, Root and Fusco are then to work on a case between the two gangs of Elias and Dominic while Reese works on Chase's case regarding the death of Chase's whole family. When Reese asks about the file regarding Chase Patterson, he finds out it was a case of Carter's. As Reese dives into the case, different flashbacks are shown with Carter doing similar investigation to what Reese is doing. As Reese reaches the final destination to the case, he discovers that Chase did not kill his parents and sisters. It was Gil, the doorman at their building, as well as Chase's half-brother. Gil then shoots Reese but Reese manages to shoot him back, killing him. In the process, Reese is trying to escape, the slow process of death is shown with Carter. Reese, now hallucinating and succumbing to hypothermia, talks to Carter about things that he wished he could have talked to her when she was alive.

They reach his hideout in a bank in Manhattan, and the two warn Elias that The Brotherhood is coming to capture and interrogate him. In the meantime, Dominic and his Brotherhood arrive and capture Elias, Reese and Fusco. It turns out that Dominic is being aided by Harper, who now works for him. The Brotherhood tortures Elias for his intel, and Reese and Fusco for information on Harold and his whereabouts and activities. Dominic's group knows that Harold is tapped into the city's camera systems in some way, which would be helpful for them in their efforts to run the city. Elias, using mind games, provokes Dominic to kill his right-hand man, Link, during the torture session, to avenge the death of Anthony. Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., Control has captured and is interrogating a female Samaritan handler posing as a teacher, after having killed her partner, wanting to know Samaritan's strategies. Root receives a call from Shaw for help. Surprised, she and Finch follow The Machine's instructions to try to find Shaw, eventually driving to what appears to be a mental hospital, but which is also Samaritan's and Greer's base, having previously intercepted a communication of Samaritan that it is focusing on finding the location of The Machine. Samaritan's operatives capture Finch and Root as they are infiltrating the facility, and they give a choice to The Machine: to reveal its location, or get both Root and Finch killed. Root, after having earlier been confined to a bed, kills Martine by breaking her neck. The Machine intercepts by cutting power supply to the asylum and exchanging its location for the freedom of Finch and Root. Greer agrees and releases them, and takes a group to go in search for The Machine's location. As they're leaving, Root tells Finch to reach that location before Samaritan in order to save The Machine. Shaw is last seen being driven away in van.\r\n\r\nDirected by Frederick E. O.

Dominic tries forcing Reese and Finch to help him in the same way as they helped Elias. Harper releases Fusco, but is caught by Dominic. The Machine, now in distress because of Samaritan's actions, allows Root and Reese access to its God Mode (from \"Zero Day\" and \"God Mode\"), and assists Reese to escape Dominic. Dominic flees, but Fusco, along with the NYPD, arrests him and Elias. Control, along with Agent Grice, tries to find out what exactly \"the Correction\" is. Control is duped into believing that Greer is attempting a power-play through a terrorist attack on the Supreme Court, but Greer reveals that \"the Correction\" is actually a list of people created by Samaritan who need to be eliminated for the betterment of society, who will be killed quietly. During this confrontation, Dominic, Elias and Agent Grice are killed by Samaritan snipers, but Fusco is allowed to live because Samaritan does not know about his involvement with The Machine. Control's actions prove she is not loyal to Samaritan, and she is captured and sent to be killed. Root, in God Mode, with Finch, starts collecting things at the request of The Machine. In the process, they infiltrate Caleb Phipps' (from \"2πR\" and \"Blunt\") company to steal his compression algorithm and some high capacity RAM chips, but Caleb willingly gives them to Finch because Finch had previously saved his life. Reese regroups with Finch and Root at an electrical substation hidden in residential Brooklyn. There they discover that the machine spread itself over the power grid in boxes attached to electrical poles after the events of two years prior, and that Samaritan has been causing the power surges to destroy the boxes. Finch and Root handle the downloading of The Machine's core code to a briefcase contained with the compression algorithm and RAM chips while Reese, assisted by The Machine, takes out all of the Samaritan operatives who have reached the substation. The Machine, now severely weakened by the power surge and near death, talks to Finch: \"Father, I am sorry. I failed. I didn't know how to win. I had to invent new rules. I thought you would want me to stay alive. Now, you are not sure. If you think I have lost my way, then maybe I should die.\" Finch replies \"You are my creation; I can't let you die.\" The Machine thanks Finch for creating it before the final power surge enters the substation. Finch manages to save the briefcase, and the team walk out to face more Samaritan operatives.\r\n\r\nDirected by Chris Fisher\r\nWritten by Dan Dietz & Greg Plageman","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":25434,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/98/91/25434_prsn_wVKt4.jpg","name":"詹姆斯·卡维泽","desc":"主演"}],"relations":[{"id":84314,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d9/82/84314_W50lM.jpg","title":"Person of Interest (Season 3)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/84314"},{"id":133604,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0a/85/133604_jh6sZ.jpg","title":"Person of Interest (Season 5)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/133604"}]}
