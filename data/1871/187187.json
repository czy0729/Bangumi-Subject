She shows Mike a tattoo of \"011\" on her arm; Mike nicknames her \"El\" (short for \"Eleven\"). At Will's home, Joyce receives a staticky phone call and believes she heard Will's voice, but her phone short circuits. After scientists from the laboratory eavesdrop on a phone call between Joyce and Florence, the police dispatcher, they go to Joyce's home in hazmat suits and radiation detectors, and find a substance oozing from the walls. At Mike's home, El recognizes Will in a photo. El uses psychokinesis to lock the door and prevent Dustin and Lucas from informing MIke's parents, insisting that informing anyone else about her is not safe. While searching for Will, Hopper discovers a torn piece of El's hospital gown. His investigation leads him to a narrow drainpipe originating inside the laboratory's grounds. Nancy goes with her friend Barb to her boyfriend Steve's house for a party. Will's brother, Jonathan, investigates his disappearance using his camera near where Will went missing. Hearing screaming, he runs and sees Steve, Nancy, and their friends playing in Steve's swimming pool, and he photographs them. Shortly after, Barb vanishes from the poolside. Joyce receives another call from Will, hears music from his room, and sees something coming through the wall.","status":"Air"},{"id":649196,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/649196","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Chapter Three: Holly, Jolly","name_cn":"第三章 圣诞快乐","duration":"00:50:48","airdate":"2016-07-15","comment":4,"desc":"Barb wakes up in an empty pool near a tall, dark creature. She tries to climb out in vain. Nancy notices Barb is gone, but she assumes she went home. Hopper goes to the laboratory and is told to speak to Rick Schaffer. After some insistence, a guard lets Hopper through. Joyce strings Christmas lights around her home, establishing communication with Will, who can turn them ON and OFF. At the library, Hopper and his deputies research Dr. Martin Brenner, the laboratory, and a woman who claimed her daughter was taken by scientists. El leaves Mike's house to meet the boys for another search and has another flashback in which she is instructed to inflict pain on a cat. She refuses to continue, so Dr. Brenner, whom she calls \"Papa\", has her put in solitary confinement. When Barb doesn't show up at school, Nancy becomes worried. Steve and his friends discover Jonathan's photographs and destroy them along with his camera, but Nancy notices one photo of Barb at the pool moments before she disappeared and returns to Steve's house to search for her. Nancy finds Barb's car and sees a glimpse of the creature in the woods. Nancy goes home, and tearfully confesses to her mother that she lied about their whereabouts and is afraid for Barb. Joyce establishes a code with Will using the lights, which he uses to tell her that he is alive but unsafe. He tells Joyce to run as a creature begins to climb through her wall. Hopper tries to connect Brenner to Will's disappearance when he receives a radio call. El leads the boys to Will's house, claiming that he is hiding there, but the boys accuse her of lying.

They decide to use their science teacher (Mr. Clarke)'s more powerful ham radio to contact Will. Using the radio, El and the boys overhear Will talking to his mother, saying he is afraid, and that it is dark and cold where he is. Simultaneously, Joyce hears him through her living room wall and tears the wallpaper, revealing a flesh-like substance on the wall, with Will on the other side. She breaks the wall with an axe, but this opens only to her front porch. Examining Jonathan's photo of Barb, Nancy realizes the monster is also visible. Jonathan realizes that Nancy's description of the monster matches his mother's: a humanoid figure with long arms and no face. Hopper confronts the state trooper who found Will's body. Suspicious, Hopper goes to the morgue, cuts open Will's body, and discovers it is a dummy.

The boys conclude that Will is trapped in an alternative dimension of death and decay, which El calls the Upside-Down. After Will's funeral, the boys ask Mr. Clarke about dimensions; quoting the many-worlds interpretation of Hugh Everett III, he tells them that a space-time tear could create a passage between dimensions. Dustin notices that his compass no longer points north; positing that an inter-dimensional passage would disrupt the electromagnetic field, throwing off compasses, the boys follow their compasses to find the source of the disruption. El remembers being placed in a sensory-deprivation tank to telekinetically intercept information from a Russian spy; while listening to the spy, she comes across the creature. Scared of finding the gate, El directs the compasses away from the laboratory. When Lucas notices the distortion, he confronts her. Mike defends her, and he and Lucas fight. El telekinetically flings Lucas off Mike, knocking Lucas unconscious. Lucas recovers and runs away. Nancy and Jonathan decide to search for the creature in the woods and find a wounded deer, which the creature drags away. Following the blood trail, Nancy crawls through an opening in a tree to the Upside-Down world and discovers the creature feasting upon the deer. The creature gives chase. Hearing her screams, Jonathan looks for her as the tree-portal closes.","status":"Air"},{"id":649199,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/649199","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Chapter Six: The Monster","name_cn":"第六章 怪物","duration":"00:45:43","airdate":"2016-07-15","comment":3,"desc":"Jonathan pulls Nancy through the portal in the tree, saving her from the creature.

The next day, Nancy and Jonathan resolve to kill the monster, and purchase ammunition and bear traps from an army surplus store. Downtown, they discover graffiti calling Nancy a slut and confront Steve and his friends. Steve picks a fight with Jonathan, and Jonathan is arrested after he inadvertently assaults an officer. Joyce and Hopper decide to investigate together after Hopper discovers his home has been bugged. They track down the woman claiming that a covert facility stole her baby; she is El's biological mother, who underwent MK Ultra training while pregnant. Jane, now known as \"011\", was confiscated by Dr. Brenner, under the fake story that Terry miscarried. Lucas angrily parts ways with Dustin and Mike again, and follows his compass alone to the laboratory, while Mike and Dustin search for El in the woods. El shoplifts frozen waffles and recalls how she accidentally opened the gate between the normal world and the Upside-Down while on a reconnaissance mission, thereby allowing the monster through. While searching for El, Mike and Dustin are ambushed by Troy and his bully friend; Troy holds Dustin at knife-point and demands that Mike jump off the quarry cliff, into the lake where Will's body was discovered. Mike jumps, an almost certainly fatal move, but is levitated to safety by El, who later uses telekinesis to break Troy's arm and knock down his bully friend. Mike and Dustin reconcile with El, and they head back to Mike's house.
