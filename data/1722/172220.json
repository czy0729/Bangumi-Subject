It is the second such Moomin film produced by Finnish children's film company Filmkompaniet, the first being Moomin and Midsummer Madness, and the first one converted to stereoscopic 3-D. A similar revision of the remainder of the series for high-definition television of all 78 episodes will follow and is currently in production. The same novel has been adapted into film at least twice before, with the 1978 Russian stop motion serial Mumi-troll and the 1992 Japanese traditional animation feature Comet in Moominland. International version of the film features the voices of known Swedish actors like Stellan Skarsgård, Peter Stormare, Alexander Skarsgård. Musician and Moomins fan Björk also wrote an original song for the film. The international debut was at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2010. In Finland, it arrived in movie theaters on 6 August 2010 and will later be broadcast on the MTV3 channel. The film will also be produced in dozens of other languages and will subsequently receive global distribution.\r\n\r\nOne day Moomintroll wakes to notice that grey dust is covering everything in the Moominvalley. He runs to ask the philosophical Muskrat if he knows what is happening, who advises him that things tend to look like this before an awful fate coming from the sky hits the Earth. With the help of his father, Moominpappa, Moomintroll and his close friends Sniff and Snufkin build a raft and head out on a challenging journey to the observatory in the Lonely Mountains hoping to find out more from the wise professors there. The friends have to overcome several adversities in order to make it there. When they arrive, they find the professors deep in calculations. They reveal that a comet will reach the Earth in four days, four hours, four minutes and 44 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe group decides to get back home as fast as they can to share the news. On the journey home, they encounter more dangerous creatures and obstacles as well as some old and new friends, including Snork Maiden and her brother Snork, who join them on their adventure. The sky continues to become redder and the air hotter. When they get to the seashore, they are shocked to see that the sea has completely dried up. A walk along the dried out sea bottom brings more excitement and danger.\r\n\r\nEventually they make it back home to the Moominhouse and discover another shocking detail: the comet is supposed to land right in their own garden that very night. Ultimately, the big question is if they can get everybody to safety in time.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>姆明谷的彗星来袭</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>原作: </span><a href=\"/person/21966\">Lars Jansson</a>、<a href=\"/person/21965\">Tove Jansson</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>姆明一族 红色彗星大追逐</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Muumi ja punainen pyrstötähti</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2010-08-06</li><li><span>片长: </span>75分钟</li><li><span>导演: </span>Maria Lindberg</li><li><span>脚本: </span>Joel Backström、Iivo Baric、Anders Larsson、Minna Karvonen</li><li><span>演出: </span>Stellan Skarsgård、Peter Stormare、Alexander Skarsgård、Mads Mikkelsen、Helena Mattsson</li><li><span>旁白: </span>Max von Sydow</li><li><span>音乐: </span>Andrzej Rokicki、Björk (song \"The Comet Song\")</li><li><span>摄影: </span>Maria Lindberg</li><li><span>剪辑: </span>Maria Lindberg</li><li><span>动画制作: </span>Stereoscape Ltd.</li><li><span>制作人: </span>Tom Carpelan</li><li><span>发行: </span>Oy Filmkompaniet Alpha Ab</li>","collection":{"wish":5,"collect":5,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"2010","count":1},{"name":"2010年","count":1},{"name":"无","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":912327,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/912327","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":21966,"image":"","name":"拉尔斯·杨笙","desc":"原作"},{"id":21965,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/59/7d/21965_prsn_TGpr7.jpg","name":"朵贝·杨笙","desc":"原作"}],"relations":[{"id":172210,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d0/80/172210_7dnZK.jpg","title":"The Moomins","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/172210"},{"id":171034,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/fc/ba/171034_TPpB2.jpg","title":"楽しいムーミン一家 ムーミン谷の彗星","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/171034"},{"id":8622,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0c/52/8622_uUg1U.jpg","title":"楽しいムーミン一家","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/8622"},{"id":171943,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/52/37/171943_eP10D.jpg","title":"Moomins on the Riviera","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/171943"},{"id":9268,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9c/ac/9268_B34J1.jpg","title":"楽しいムーミン一家 冒険日記","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/9268"},{"id":172257,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c6/a7/172257_Pm3x3.jpg","title":"Die Muminfamilie","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/172257"}]}
