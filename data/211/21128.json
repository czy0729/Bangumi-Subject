Check in here for the latest news, gossip and exclusive content courtesy of Carnival Film & Television Ltd. We hope you’ll enjoy your stay, and come back again soon - we’ll be posting exclusive new clips, photos and updates weekly, because whether you’re first-time visitor to Hotel Babylon or a regular guest, all our fans deserve five star treatment. \r\n　　The big news is Nigel Harman is Hotel Babylon’s new star this year. He plays Sam Franklin, a sexy suave and impulsive businessman, joining all your favourite returning characters; Anna, Tony, Gino, James, Ben, Emily and Tanya in the hit BBC One show which takes a tantalizing and seductive insight into the sexy world of the luxury five-star hotel industry. \r\n　　Hotel Babylon lifts the lid on the service industry. When people are paying upwards of three hundred pounds a night for a room, they’re prepared to leave real life at the door and play as hard as they want. Film directors rub shoulders with con-artists, child stars mingle with business billionaires and food gurus chat with glitterati. Weddings and Valentine’s Day, fashion shows and film shoots all combine to produce a heady, hedonistic cocktail where anything can, and does, happen. \r\n　　When Sam Franklin (Harman) attempts to check into Hotel Babylon in episode one, little does he know that his ex-wife, Juliet (Wilson-Jones), has been appointed as a trouble-shooter to either shut down or save the hotel. As the day unfolds some disturbing events threaten the hotel’s equilibrium and Sam decides to take matters into his own hands. Several phone calls later and Sam Franklin is the new owner of Hotel Babylon, much to his ex-wife’s annoyance. \r\n　　With a Bollywood style wedding, a celebrity magazine shoot, mafia gangsters and lots of guest stars checking in, series 4 will, in true Hotel Babylon style, keep audiences captivated and entertained all through the Summer.
