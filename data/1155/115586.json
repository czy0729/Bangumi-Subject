You play a freelance spy who takes jobs from his clients to break into high security buildings and steal sensitive data. \r\n\r\nTo get past security, you'll need to make creative use of your main gadget: the Crosslink. It lets you see how all the security devices in a level are wired up, and then you can just click and drag with the mouse to wire them differently. So you can connect a lightswitch to a trapdoor, then flick it when a guard walks across to make him fall through.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>枪口</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Puzzle-platform</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Game Maker 8</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2013年6月3日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$9.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.gunpointgame.com/</li>","collection":{"wish":7,"collect":10,"doing":1,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":4},{"name":"PUZ","count":2},{"name":"普通游戏","count":1},{"name":"2015","count":1},{"name":"像素","count":1},{"name":"独立游戏","count":1}]}
