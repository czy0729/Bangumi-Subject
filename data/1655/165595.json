It was developed by Dutch video game development company Two Tribes B.V. and is their first published video game. The game follows a young chick, Toki Tori, and his quest to rescue his younger siblings, still in their eggs. To progress through the game, the player must pick up each egg on a level using a set number of tools, with new tools being introduced as the player progresses through the four worlds. This usually involves careful planning and creative thinking.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>小鸡快跑</li><li><span>平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>GBC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Platform/puzzle</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2001年9月12日(GBC)</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">发行日期: </span>2010年1月29日(Windows)</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.tokitori.com/</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":5},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":4},{"name":"Platform","count":2},{"name":"PUZ","count":2},{"name":"WII","count":2},{"name":"解谜","count":2},{"name":"STEAM","count":2}],"relations":[{"id":165599,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/87/0f/165599_0kyT9.jpg","title":"Toki Tori 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/165599"}]}
