It was Buñuel's first film and was initially released in 1929 with a limited showing at Studio des Ursulines in Paris, but became popular and ran for eight months.\r\nUn Chien Andalou has no plot in the conventional sense of the word. The chronology of the film is disjointed, jumping from the initial \"once upon a time\" to \"eight years later\" without the events or characters changing. It uses dream logic in narrative flow that can be described in terms of then-popular Freudian free association, presenting a series of tenuously related scenes. \r\n(via wikipedia)","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>一条安达鲁狗</li><li><span>别名: </span>An Andalusian Dog</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>安达卢西亚之犬</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>安达鲁之犬</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>一条叫安达鲁的狗</li><li><span>集数: </span>1</li><li><span>类型: </span>短片 / 奇幻</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>法国</li><li><span>imdb_id: </span>tt0020530</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1929-06-06(法国)</li><li><span>片长: </span>16分钟</li><li><span>导演: </span>Luis Buñuel</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Salvador Dalí / Luis Buñuel</li><li><span>主演: </span>Simone Mareuil / Pierre Batcheff / Luis Buñuel / Salvador Dalí / Robert Hommet</li>","collection":{"collect":10},"eps":[{"id":851740,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/851740","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"lock":"条目已锁定"}
