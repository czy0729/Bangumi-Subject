Players are given a task, but also the means to eliminate each other from the game. The goal is to blend in with the NPCs, accomplish the task at hand, and take out other players before they get you.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>大隐隐于市</li><li><span>平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Xbox One</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Party game</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>2 - 4人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2011年11月18日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Adam Spragg</li><li><span>发行: </span>Adam Spragg</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"LocalPVP","count":1},{"name":"普通游戏","count":1},{"name":"party","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1}]}
