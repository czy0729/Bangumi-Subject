Geordie suspects flash Larry Simkins, owner of the strip club where Linda worked and where she met Bill but the nature of the murder reminds Geordie of an identical unsolved case from three years earlier and switches his attentions to the prime suspect at the time, gruff toy-shop owner Albert Tannen, who is violently attacked. Sidney eventually unmasks the killer whilst Mrs Maguire and Leonard deliver her baby for Amanda, pregnant by estranged husband Guy, cast out by her bigoted father and hoping for a future with Sidney.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>牧师神探：2016圣诞特辑</li><li><span>集数: </span>1</li><li><span>开始: </span>2016-12-24</li><li><span>结束: </span>2016-12-24</li><li><span>类型: </span>罪案</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>电视台: </span>iTV</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"英剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":692232,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/692232","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":174669,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/ed/b5/174669_A22Xl.jpg","title":"Grantchester Season 2","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/174669"},{"id":215628,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/6d/75/215628_g7x2L.jpg","title":"Grantchester Season 3","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/215628"}]}
