The game was published by Capcom and run on their CPS-2 arcade system board. Mars Matrix was later ported to the Dreamcast video game console in 2001. The arcade version is notable for using a horizontally aligned monitor (much like Giga Wing), something that is considered rare for a vertical shooter.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>火星矩阵-超固体射击</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/471\">CAPCOM</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>弹丸地狱</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Mars Matrix: Hyper Solid Shooting</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Mars Matrix</li><li><span>平台: </span>ARC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>DC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>纵版STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1 - 2人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2000年4月</li><li><span>开发: </span>Takumi Corporation</li>","collection":{"collect":3,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"ARC","count":2},{"name":"STG","count":2},{"name":"TAKUMI","count":1},{"name":"ARCADE","count":1},{"name":"街机","count":1},{"name":"Capcom","count":1},{"name":"2000","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":471,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/df/70/471_prsn_F2kjF.jpg","name":"卡普空","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":314571,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d0/ad/314571_3W6Qc.jpg","title":"マーズマトリックス＆ギガウイング2 オリジナル・サウンドトラック","type":"原声集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/314571"}]}
