In every level, the rules themselves are present as blocks you can interact with; by manipulating them, you can change how the level works and cause surprising, unexpected interactions! With some simple block-pushing you can turn yourself into a rock, turn patches of grass into dangerously hot obstacles, and even change the goal you need to reach to something entirely different.\r\n\r\nThe game has over 200 levels that experiment with the game's mechanics in a multitude of ways, requiring the player to understand and manipulate the rules of the game and figure out devious ways to make the objects in the game world interact.\r\n\r\nThe game was originally created for and won the Nordic Game Jam 2017. Baba Is You also won the Excellence in Design and Best Student Game awards in the Independent Games Festival 2018, and was nominated a finalist in 2 other categories, including the Seumas McNally Grand Prize. The game was made using Multimedia Fusion 2 by Clickteam.","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>巴巴是你</li><li><span>平台: </span>Android</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Nintendo Switch</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS X</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>Puzzle</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Multimedia Fusion 2</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2019年3月13日</li><li><span>售价: </span>14.99 USD</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.hempuli.com/baba/</li><li><span>开发: </span>Hempuli Oy</li><li><span>发行: </span>Hempuli Oy</li><li><span>游戏设计师: </span>Arvi Teikari</li><li><span>程序: </span>Arvi Teikari</li><li><span>音乐: </span>Arvi Teikari</li>","collection":{"on_hold":64,"dropped":16,"wish":141,"collect":255,"doing":85},"tags":[{"name":"解谜","count":75},{"name":"PC","count":74},{"name":"独立游戏","count":69},{"name":"PUZ","count":40},{"name":"2019","count":34},{"name":"STEAM","count":21},{"name":"智商不够用","count":16},{"name":"芬兰","count":11},{"name":"欧美","count":10},{"name":"Puzzle","count":9},{"name":"Hempuli","count":8},{"name":"NS","count":7},{"name":"EN","count":6},{"name":"独立","count":3},{"name":"神作","count":2},{"name":"Switch","count":2},{"name":"颠覆性的游戏体验","count":1},{"name":"小作","count":1},{"name":"电脑","count":1},{"name":"茅塞顿开","count":1},{"name":"待买","count":1},{"name":"治愈","count":1},{"name":"像素风","count":1},{"name":"烧脑","count":1},{"name":"AVG","count":1},{"name":"同人","count":1}]}
