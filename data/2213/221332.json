The battles are presented in an isometric perspective with line-of-sight occlusions and practical cover. Sudden Strike helped pioneer the real-time tactics genre, building upon concepts established by Counter Action for DOS, which was published by Mindscape in 1996.\r\n\r\nSudden Strike utilizes accurate in-game physics with houses and buildings obstructing units' view, line-of-sight and firing range whereas clumps of trees can provide cover to reduce the damage of tank ordnance. The game allows units to garrison a building for a stronger firing position, especially valuable for anti-tank infantry. Units can also hold their fire, providing much-needed reconnaissance. Damage evaluation is also realistic; tanks or other vehicles that take too much damage are rendered immobile unless repairs are made.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>突袭</li><li><span>发行: </span>Cdv Software Entertainment, <a href=\"/person/34218\">Strategy First</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>RTT</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2001-01-24</li><li><span>开发: </span>Fireglow Games</li>","collection":{"collect":4,"on_hold":1},"tags":[{"name":"RTT","count":2},{"name":"俄罗斯","count":1},{"name":"2001","count":1},{"name":"STEAM","count":1},{"name":"童年","count":1},{"name":"二战","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":34218,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/82/88/34218_prsn_RbU1b.jpg","name":"策略第一","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":228775,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/09/d8/228775_JJ2ee.jpg","title":"Sudden Strike 2","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/228775"}]}
