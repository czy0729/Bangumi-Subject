Things begin badly when Davis accidentally shoots an Ibex, the national animal, while on a hunting trip with the president - and are further jeopardized when an arrogant young British human rights activist is arrested by the regime on trumped-up charges. This throws Davis into direct conflict with Neil, who believes Britain should be prioritising human rights over winning arms contracts. Neil, though, has ethical troubles of his own when the Tazbek secret police blackmail him into spying on the British for them. \r\n　　The embassy is hosting a 'Best of British Festival' which offers an opportunity for Davis to impress the Tazbeks and persuade them to go with the British helicopters. However, the best the festival can offer is a medieval folk group from Gloucestershire, a demonstration of how to make a pork pie and a one-man production of Frankenstein. Nobody, least of all Davis, is feeling too confident...Then news reaches them that the human rights activist is facing the death penalty and the ambassador and his team are forced to make a tough decision.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>大使</li><li><span>集数: </span>3</li><li><span>开始: </span>2013-10-23</li><li><span>类型: </span>喜剧</li><li><span>国家/地区: </span>英国</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li><li><span>每集长: </span>30分钟</li><li><span>频道: </span>BBC</li>","collection":{"collect":2},"tags":[{"name":"英剧","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":645855,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/645855","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":645856,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/645856","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":645857,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/645857","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
