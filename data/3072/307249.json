It shows three next pieces on GBA and six next pieces on other platforms. Unlike later games, the game had an autorepeat feature for the rotation button; holding down the rotation key kept the piece spinning continually.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>俄罗斯方块世界</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/16404\">THQ</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>テトリスワールド</li><li><span>平台: </span>GBA</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>NGC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS2</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>XBOX</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2001年9月24日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Blue Planet Software</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"俄罗斯方块","count":1},{"name":"单机","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"GBA","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":16404,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b5/f5/16404_prsn_IwyQE.jpg","name":"THQ公司","desc":"发行"}]}
