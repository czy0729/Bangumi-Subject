However, experienced players take advantage of existence of hard drop. This version of Tetris would be later followed by Tetris 2 + Bombliss, which has more standardized controls without hard drop.\r\n\r\nNot to be confused with Nintendo's version, which was the version released outside Japan.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>俄罗斯方块（BPS版）</li><li><span>别名: </span>テトリス</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>Tetris (BPS)</li><li><span>平台: </span>FC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>PUZ</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1988年12月22日</li><li><span>发行: </span>Bullet Proof Software</li>","collection":{"collect":1,"doing":1},"tags":[{"name":"NES","count":1},{"name":"俄罗斯方块","count":1},{"name":"FC","count":1}]}
