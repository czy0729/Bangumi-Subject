It features the voices of Mae Whitman, Brenda Song, Megan Hilty, and others, as Tinker Bell and the other fairies of Pixie Hollow in Never Land, taking part in an Olympic-style competition. It is based loosely on J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan stories, by way of Disney's animated adaptation.\r\nIt was originally intended as the last of five feature-length films in the Tinker Bell series of direct-to-DVD 3D animated films, with the title Tinker Bell: Race through the Seasons, and a release date in 2012. However, the movie was rescheduled and retooled as a TV special instead of a film-length movie. Unlike the previous feature films in this series, Tinker Bell is not a central featured character in this special release. It aired on June 4th, 2012 in the UK.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>小叮当与精灵杯大赛</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2011-11-19</li><li><span>动画制作: </span><a href=\"/person/13959\">DisneyToon Studios</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Tinker Bell Pixie Hollow Games</li>","collection":{"wish":6,"collect":11,"dropped":4},"tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":4},{"name":"迪士尼","count":4},{"name":"Disney","count":2},{"name":"剧场版","count":2},{"name":"2011","count":2},{"name":"美国","count":2},{"name":"TV","count":2},{"name":"MaeWhitman","count":1},{"name":"MichaelSheen","count":1},{"name":"BobHilgenberg","count":1},{"name":"美国动画","count":1},{"name":"迪斯尼","count":1},{"name":"TinkerBell","count":1},{"name":"BradleyRaymond","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":495440,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/495440","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"crt":[{"id":14281,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/19/1e/14281_crt_dzM8m.jpg","name":"小叮当","desc":"主角"}],"staff":[{"id":13959,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a6/d6/13959_prsn_jBDf5.jpg","name":"迪士尼动画工作室","desc":"动画制作"}],"relations":[{"id":24620,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/dd/26/24620_6WwHw.jpg","title":"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/24620"},{"id":24621,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f4/20/24621_4eA06.jpg","title":"Tinker Bell: Secret of the Wings","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/24621"}]}
