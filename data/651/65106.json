Armed with only a \"duty to do\" card (a card that elicits a \"doo-ti-too-doo\" sound when inserted into the corresponding slot on a computer) and an endless supply of muffins, Manny manages to resist Fran's rather self-serving attempts to drag him back to Bernard so that she has somewhere to hang out. Bernard's physical condition deteriorates rapidly without Manny's care (\"I feel like I've been beaten up, underwater\"), but Manny is soon questioning his choice of career as Evan demands an unthinkable sacrifice.\r\n\r\nGuest star: Simon Pegg as Evan."},{"id":244081,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/244081","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Elephants and Hens","duration":"00:23:53","airdate":"2004-03-18","comment":2,"desc":"Fran leaves for the weekend to go to her friend Becky's hen party while Bernard and Manny, inspired by their latest children's-book event, decide to write and illustrate a book for children. Bernard's first effort comes to over 1,000 pages, covers Joseph Stalin, a lens grinder, a broken marriage, and a truth-seeking journalist – a bit complex for kids. The subsequent masterpiece, The Elephant and the Balloon, could bring them international fame—and all its problems. Meanwhile, Fran's hen party is a disaster: the booze starts flowing, and a game of truth stirs up tears and recriminations.\r\n\r\nGuest stars: Lucy Davis as Becky, Olivia Colman as Tanya, Charlie Hicks as Timmy and, Oliver Golding as Young Customer."},{"id":244082,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/244082","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Moo-Ma and Moo-Pa","duration":"00:24:30","airdate":"2004-03-25","comment":2,"desc":"Manny's irritating parents, 'Moo-Ma' and 'Moo-Pa', unexpectedly come to stay after Bernard deletes Manny's answerphone messages.

Being utterly hopeless at cards, Bernard (now nicknamed The Gold Mine) loses everything, and Fran and Manny need to hatch a plan to obtain the money before Bernard's debtors \"evict\" him from his shop, £20,000, and/or his legs.\r\n\r\nGuest stars: Keith Allen as 'Mouse Ears' Smith and Craig Parkinson as Martin the Tout."},{"id":244084,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/244084","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"Travel Writer","duration":"00:24:09","airdate":"2004-04-08","comment":2,"desc":"Manny organises a book launch party at the shop with charismatic-but-smug travel writer Jason, and everyone starts falling for him and his stories of far-away adventure.

Instantly jealous, Bernard overcomes his natural reluctance with curiosity to see what kind of \"so-called person\" could find Manny attractive. Manny arms himself with an array of items to strategically leave about the house to give him an excuse to call her, and Fran checks her perfect new hairstyle. They return much later armed with a bizarre selection of alcohol, messed-up hair, and a desire to dance badly. An excess of beetroot liqueur gives Manny the courage to confront Bernard regarding his disdain for Manny's affection for Rowena — this brings forth a shocking revelation from Bernard, which is soon tarnished as Fran tells Manny the truth about Bernard."}],"staff":[{"id":56728,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/62/99/56728_prsn_6Bk6K.jpg","name":"Olivia Colman","desc":"配角"}],"relations":[{"id":10677,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/80/56/10677_FFyFZ.jpg","title":"Black Books (Series 2)","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/10677"}]}
