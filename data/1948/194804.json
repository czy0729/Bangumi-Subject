A string of mysterious serial killings plagues the city. \r\nThe detectives of the 24 Wards Heinous Crimes Unit have their eyes on one man: Kamui Uehara, legendary serial killer and assassin of a number of government officials 20 years prior in the now-famous \"Silver Case\". However, nobody knows who - or what - Kamui really is. \r\n\r\nHas he really returned? Who is this infamous serial killer? \r\n\r\nAs player, you will take control of the protagonist - a member of the Special Forces Unit known as “Republic” - from a first-person perspective. Inspired by classic adventure and visual novel-style games, The Silver Case offers a fresh and unique gameplay experience as it leads the player through an in-depth story containing various puzzles, uncovering the truth piece by piece. \r\n\r\nThe Silver Case was the debut game from developer SUDA51, creator of titles such as Flower, Sun and Rain, Killer 7, the No More Heroes series, Lollipop Chainsaw and most recently LET IT DIE. Now, The Silver Case HD Remaster - the new and improved version of Grasshopper Manufacture Inc.'s maiden title - is coming to various PC distribution platforms in the fall of 2016. \r\n\r\nThe game will be fully remastered while still retaining the same feel and atmosphere of the original PSX version from 1999. It will also be fully localized into English for the first time ever, finally giving SUDA51 fans throughout the world the chance to enjoy The Silver Case.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>银色事件</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/26067\">グラスホッパー・マニファクチュア</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/39133\">ASCII</a></li><li><span>遊戲設計師: </span><a href=\"/person/15968\">須田剛一</a></li><li><span>剧本: </span><a href=\"/person/15968\">須田剛一</a></li><li><span>导演: </span><a href=\"/person/15968\" rel=\"v:directedBy\">須田剛一</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>The Silver Case HD Remaster</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>The Silver Case</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Unity 5</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>PC版 2016年10月7日（HD Remaster）</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">发行日期: </span>PS版 1999年10月7日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$19.99/￥68/1980円</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://thesilvercase.com</li>","collection":{"wish":27,"collect":7,"doing":2,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":5},{"name":"须田刚一","count":3},{"name":"suda51","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":26067,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/87/20/26067_prsn_10av8.jpg","name":"草蜢工作室","desc":"开发"},{"id":39133,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/d2/03/39133_prsn_IcYel.jpg","name":"ASCII.jp","desc":"发行"},{"id":15968,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/30/2a/15968_prsn_FIT7w.jpg","name":"须田刚一","desc":"遊戲設計師"}],"relations":[{"id":332969,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/99/e9/332969_cbU47.jpg","title":"シルバー事件25区","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/332969"},{"id":13155,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/af/d2/13155_E3t9i.jpg","title":"花と太陽と雨と","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/13155"},{"id":253959,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/57/02/253959_x4QT8.jpg","title":"シルバー2425","type":"不同演绎","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/253959"}]}
