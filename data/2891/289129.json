It is the sequel to Gothic II.\r\n\r\nA Collector's Edition was released containing bonus collectible material. JoWooD released a standalone expansion, entitled Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods, in November 2008.\r\n\r\nThe player must complete quests and slay wild animals and monsters to earn experience and improve skills. The game is reputation centric allowing the player to side with a faction. While there are six factions in the game, only three are joinable: the Rebels, the Orc mercenaries and the Hashishin. The remaining factions are the Rangers, the Nomads and the people of Nordmar. The player is able to take advantage of missions to allow either side to take over towns. Dialog changes according to in-game actions and behavior. The game places a special focus on the interactivity of the environment. The controls have been altered slightly with a stronger focus on action. Navigation and combat are more mouse-centric, with each mouse button having a different combat action. The Nameless Hero can also now wield dual weapons or use a shield.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>哥特王朝3</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ARPG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2006年10月13日</li><li><span>开发: </span>Piranha Bytes</li><li><span>发行: </span>JoWooD Productions</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1,"dropped":1},"relations":[{"id":318361,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/2a/3d/318361_7Hfw8.jpg","title":"Gothic II","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/318361"},{"id":84727,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e2/70/84727_64N70.jpg","title":"Arcania: Gothic 4","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/84727"}]}
