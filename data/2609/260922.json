It was released in 1999 throughout Japan, North America, and Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment.\r\nThe game features mecha designs by Shoji Kawamori of Macross fame.\r\nBeing released late in the PlayStation's life, Omega Boost is said to have some of the best graphics on the console with parts of the game running at 60 frame/s. The game was criticized by some reviewers for being too short (Nine levels with nine unlockable special missions) and simplistic. However, it is still considered one of the best Macross-style mecha simulation games produced and is thought of by many as a sleeper hit due to its poor marketing.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>终极推进</li><li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/34980\">Polyphony Digital</a></li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/1018\">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a></li><li><span>遊戲設計師: </span><a href=\"/person/34981\">山内一典</a></li><li><span>机械设定: </span><a href=\"/person/253\">河森正治</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Omega Boost</li><li><span>平台: </span>PS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>TPS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1999年4月22日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1,"doing":1},"staff":[{"id":34980,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/38/f6/34980_prsn_kAsaN.jpg","name":"Polyphony Digital","desc":"开发"},{"id":1018,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/37/28/1018_prsn_Yvv5n.jpg","name":"索尼互动娱乐","desc":"发行"},{"id":34981,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/02/13/34981_prsn_ojdaC.jpg","name":"山内一典","desc":"遊戲設計師"},{"id":253,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/f4/52/253_prsn_kGMNC.jpg","name":"河森正治","desc":"机械设定"}]}
