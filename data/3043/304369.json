Sell items, gather resources and build your own trade empire in the clouds! Merchant of the Skies is the trading game with light base-building and tycoon elements. You start off as a captain of a small cloudship and work your way towards establishing your own trade company.\r\n\r\nMerchant of the skies is an experimental game: it does not have a distinct genre, but tries to capture the feeling of traveling the world and establishing your own company. That means we try to incorporate exploration, base building, trading and some minor rpg elements into the game.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>天空商人</li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SIM</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2020年4月17日</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://coldwild.com/game/MerchantOfTheSkies/</li><li><span>开发: </span>Coldwild Games</li><li><span>发行: </span>Coldwild Games</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":3},"tags":[{"name":"视频通关","count":1},{"name":"SIM","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1}]}
