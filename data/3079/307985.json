The first one, entitled \"Forbidden Rhythm\", is a bizarre horror story. The protagonist, a young man named Kyouichi, finds himself in an old mansion, which seems to contain an evil energy - dead bodies, ghosts, apparitions haunt Kyouichi, who has to recall childhood events and the incestuous feelings towards his sister.\r\n\r\n2. The second story is named \"Cosplaytor II\", and is set in Tokyo, in 2019. Entertainment as we know it has disappeared off the face of the Earth, replaced by a global virtual reality game, that became the ultimate reality for many people. The player controls an agent known only by his codename (\"Z\"), who has to investigate criminal occurrences that might lead to a world-wide cyber-conspiracy.","info":"<li><span>开发: </span><a href=\"/person/15051\">Forest</a></li><li><span>剧本: </span><a href=\"/person/7115\">藤木隻</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>Marginal Stories</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>ADV</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>1993-03-31</li><li><span>原画: </span>岡部功</li><li><span>音楽: </span>CH1</li><li><span>ブランド: </span>Forest</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2},"staff":[{"id":15051,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b8/8e/15051_prsn_P6Vvn.jpg","name":"Forest","desc":"开发"},{"id":7115,"image":"","name":"藤木隻","desc":"剧本"}]}
