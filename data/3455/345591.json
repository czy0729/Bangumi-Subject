Upon returning to his trailer home, Smith is confonted by a group of A.R.G.U.S. agents: Clemson Murn, Emilia Harcourt, John Economos, and newcomer Leota Adebayo. They give him the choice of returning to Belle Reve prison or joining a new mission dubbed \"Project Butterfly\". Smith visits his father, Auggie, to retrieve his pet eagle Eagly and acquire a new outfit. He then has dinner with the team and Murn gives him a dossier of an assassination target. Smith later attempts to flirt with Harcourt in a bar, but is rejected and instead goes home with a different woman at the bar. Meanwhile, Adebayo privately discusses her role in Project Butterfly with her mother, A.R.G.U.S. leader Amanda Waller. The woman that Smith is with attacks him and reveals that she has superhuman strength. During the following fight, Smith activates a sonic boom weapon in his helmet that destroys the woman."},{"id":1047651,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1047651","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Best Friends, For Never","duration":"00:40:44","airdate":"2022-01-13","comment":1,"desc":""},{"id":1047652,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1047652","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"Better Goff Dead","duration":"00:39:38","airdate":"2022-01-13","comment":1,"desc":""},{"id":1047653,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/1047653","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"The Choad Less Traveled","duration":"00:46:54","airdate":"2022-01-20","comment":2,"desc":"The group take Judomaster back to their headquarters, where Smith claims that he killed the Butterfly.

Song resorts to requesting help from her uncle, a judge. Smith uses a helmet with X-ray vision to learn that all of the factory employees are Butterflies, as well as an escaped gorilla named Charlie.
