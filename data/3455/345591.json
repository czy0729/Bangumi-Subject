Upon returning to his trailer home, Smith is confonted by a group of A.R.G.U.S. agents: Clemson Murn, Emilia Harcourt, John Economos, and newcomer Leota Adebayo. They give him the choice of returning to Belle Reve prison or joining a new mission dubbed \"Project Butterfly\". Smith visits his father, Auggie, to retrieve his pet eagle Eagly and acquire a new outfit. He then has dinner with the team and Murn gives him a dossier of an assassination target. Smith later attempts to flirt with Harcourt in a bar, but is rejected and instead goes home with a different woman at the bar. Meanwhile, Adebayo privately discusses her role in Project Butterfly with her mother, A.R.G.U.S. leader Amanda Waller. The woman that Smith is with attacks him and reveals that she has superhuman strength.
