He got my attention, I’m jealous). This may also remind you of the beautiful sand animation by Ukraine’s Got Talent performer , Kseniya Simonova. \r\n　　You think you're just a passenger and that nothing leaves a footprint. Don't forget that you are a message in a bottle.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>慢慢来</li><li><span>别名: </span>请先留步</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2008</li><li><span>片长: </span>4分44秒</li><li><span>导演: </span>Cesar Diaz Melendez</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":6,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":2},{"name":"2000s","count":1},{"name":"2008年","count":1},{"name":"欧洲","count":1},{"name":"2008","count":1},{"name":"欧美","count":1}]}
