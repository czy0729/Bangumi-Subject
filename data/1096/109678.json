The game introduces several significant gameplay changes that center around user control. 'Hands-On Control' scheme allows for one-to-one responsiveness of a player's movement and actions on the court, as opposed to traditional predetermined animations that require users to wait while a scenario played out before making the next move. Hands-on Control applies to everything within a player's offensive and defensive arsenal, including: dribble moves, dunks, drives to the basket, fadeaways, mid-air adjustments, blocks, steals and more.\r\n\r\nThe real-time physics system in NBA Elite 11 allows each player on the court to move independently of one another, removing the two-man interactions that have long taken the user control out of basketball simulation videogames. In addition, a skill-based shooting system requires accurate user input, based on a player's position on the court, versus the randomly generated dice rolls that have driven shooting in basketball videogames in the past.\r\n\r\nThe game also comes bundled with a one-time download code for a customized version of the 2010 edition of NBA Jam, created as a bonus for NBA Elite buyers and featuring high-definition visuals.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>NBA精英11</li><li><span>平台: </span>iOS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PS3/XBOX360(取消，召回)</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SPG</li><li><span>售价: </span>59.99 USD</li><li><span>发行: </span>Electronic Arts</li><li><span>开发: </span>Electronic Arts</li>","collection":{"wish":1},"tags":[{"name":"SPG","count":1},{"name":"XBOX360","count":1},{"name":"EA","count":1},{"name":"PS3","count":1}],"relations":[{"id":302204,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/aa/19/302204_2p7DW.jpg","title":"NBA LIVE 14","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/302204"}]}
