They are later informed by an agent of an interstellar peace-keeping agency (whose secret identity is the groundskeeper at a Pebble Beach golf course) that they have become the host bodies of warriors from the planet Altara in M78 to capture escaped monsters from the planet Sorkin who have arrived on Earth. They become the Ultra Force, headquartered within Mount Rushmore, and are assisted by a trio of robots, (the pint-sized Andy, the strong Samson, and the twitchy Ulysses). Although equipped with futuristic fighter crafts, inevitably one or more of the team is required to transform into an Ultraman, a gigantic red and silver superhuman being, to battle the monsters. After destroying the most powerful Sorkin monster, the constantly growing King Maira, the Ultra Force remains together to combat further threats to planet Earth.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>奥特曼USA</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1987年10月12日</li><li><span>片长: </span>75分钟</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":7,"dropped":1},"tags":[{"name":"奥特曼","count":3},{"name":"电视电影","count":1},{"name":"圆谷","count":1},{"name":"动画电影","count":1},{"name":"TVSP","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":856425,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/856425","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
