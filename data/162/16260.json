Sir Humphrey's solution is to offer the chairmanship of the inquiry to someone hoping to score brownie points with the government. The Minister is concerned when he learns that a brand new hospital has been open for 15 months and has yet to admit a patient despite having over 500 administrative personnel on staff. His attempts to either open the hospital to the public or cut the administrative staff, are blocked at every turn until he comes up with a unique solution.","status":"Air"},{"id":93183,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/93183","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Doing the Honours","name_cn":"无功受禄","duration":"28:30","airdate":"1981-03-02","comment":10,"desc":"The Minister is appalled when, on the advice of his civil servants, he can't make a modest 5% to his department's budget. To Sir Humphrey's great disbelief, the Minister decides to recommend only those civil servants for the Queen's honors list who can find the 5% cut in their budgets. On another matter, Appleby is approached by the Master of his Oxford college who is finding it impossible to enroll students now that the Minister has instructed that all foreign students must pay the full cost of their studies. Hoping for an exemption from the requirement, they invite the Minister to an alcohol-fueled dinner and the promise of an honorary Doctor of Laws seems to do the trick.","status":"Air"},{"id":93184,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/93184","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"The Death List","name_cn":"死亡名单","duration":"29:19","airdate":"1981-03-09","comment":5,"desc":"The Minister is appalled to learn that while in Opposition, he was under government surveillance.

Appleby convinces the Minister that there is absolutely nothing to worry about but as protests against the chemical contract begin to mount - and as 10 Downing Street has clearly indicated to the Minister that he is not to proceed - Minister Hacker must move quickly to ensure that an about to be released government report supports his new position.","status":"Air"},{"id":93186,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/93186","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"The Devil You Know","name_cn":"两害相权","duration":"29:40","airdate":"1981-03-23","comment":6,"desc":"The Minister and Sir Humphrey debate the merits of UK membership in the European Community with Hacker definitely negative about interference from Brussels.

Sir Humphrey on the other hand disagrees and suggests there are many benefits to UK participation. Their views take a considerable turn however when the rumors of a Cabinet shuffle also reveal that Hacker may be offered a senior position in Brussels. When Sir Humphrey learns who the new minister might be, he is definitely keen on Hacker remaining just where he is.","status":"Air"},{"id":93187,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/93187","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"The Quality of Life","name_cn":"生活质量","duration":"29:13","airdate":"1981-03-30","comment":6,"desc":"The Minister has become concerned over the general quality of life and is not too keen to approve a six-story extension to new high-rise office building banker Sir Desmond Glazebrook is proposing.
