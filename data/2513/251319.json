Since March 2, 2006, the intellectual property rights of the game have been owned by Rebellion Developments.\r\nThe game is inspired by the spy thriller genre (notably the James Bond film series), and is set in an alternative 1960s–70s era. Most closely resembling Dungeon Keeper, players act as a villainous force attempting to achieve global domination whilst fending off the forces of justice; to this end the gameplay is split between management of a base and the completion of \"acts of infamy\" in the rest of the world. The game has stylish, cartoon-like visuals and contains a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humour, particularly playing to clichés of the spy genre.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>邪恶天才</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/31207\">Sierra Entertainment</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>SIM、RTS</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2004年9月28日</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"模拟","count":1},{"name":"RTS","count":1},{"name":"SIM","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":31207,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a6/cd/31207_prsn_v4z4M.jpg","name":"雪乐山公司","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":284444,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0d/24/284444_DDusU.jpg","title":"Evil Genius 2: World Domination","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/284444"}]}
