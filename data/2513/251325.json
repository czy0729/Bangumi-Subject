It was released on 8 November 2005 in North America, and 11 November 2005 in Europe after reaching gold status on 8 October 2005. The game allows players to take the role of a Hollywood film mogul, running a studio and creating films. Much has been made about the film-making aspect of the game, as it allows players to easily create viewable works or machinima. It won Best Simulation Game at the BAFTA Video Games Awards and was nominated for best game at the Game Developers Choice Awards.\r\nOn 6 June 2006, an expansion pack was released, The Movies: Stunts & Effects. This expansion added a host of new features, among which were stunts (and stunt doubles), and special effects, as well as the ability to designate custom camera angles.
