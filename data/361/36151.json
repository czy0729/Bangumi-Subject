With her best fish friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts and goes to the surface of the ocean to visit Scuttle the seagull, who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She constantly ignores the warnings of her father, King Triton and adviser, Sebastian that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden, longing to join the human world and become a human herself.\r\n\r\nOne night, Ariel, Flounder and an unwilling Sebastian travel to the ocean surface to watch a celebration for the birthday of Prince Eric on a ship, with whom Ariel falls in love. In an ensuing storm the ship is destroyed and Ariel saves the unconscious Eric from drowning. Ariel sings to him, but quickly leaves as soon as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find who saved and sung to him and Ariel vows to find a way to join him and his world. Noticing a change in Ariel's behavior, Triton questions Sebastian about her behavior and learns of her love for Eric. Triton furiously confronts Ariel in her grotto, where she and Flounder store human artifacts, and destroys the objects with his trident in a blind rage. After Triton leaves, a pair of eels, Flotsam and Jetsam, convince Ariel to visit Ursula the sea witch in order to be with Eric.\r\n\r\nUrsula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days in exchange for Ariel's voice, which Ursula puts in a nautilus shell. Within these three days, Ariel must receive the 'kiss of true love' from Eric; otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. Ariel is then given human legs and taken to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian. Eric finds Ariel on the beach and takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who had saved him earlier, assuming her to be a mute shipwreck survivor. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Angered at their narrow escape, Ursula takes the disguise of a beautiful young woman named \"Vanessa\" and appears onshore singing with Ariel's voice. Eric recognizes the song and, in her disguise, Ursula casts a hypnotic enchantment on Eric to make him forget about Ariel.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Ariel finds out that Eric will be married to the disguised Ursula. Scuttle discovers that Vanessa is Ursula in disguise, and informs Ariel who immediately goes after the wedding barge. Sebastian informs Triton, and Scuttle disrupts the wedding with the help of various animals. In the chaos, the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck is broken, restoring Ariel's voice and breaking Ursula's enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel was the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Ursula reverts to her true form and kidnaps Ariel. Triton confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release, but the deal is inviolable. At Ursula's urging, he agrees to take Ariel's place as Ursula's prisoner. Ariel is released as Triton transforms into a polyp and loses his authority over Atlantica. Ursula declares herself the new ruler and a struggle ensues in which Ursula accidentally kills Flotsam and Jetsam. In her rage, Ursula uses the trident to grow to monstrous proportions.\r\n\r\nAriel and Eric reconcile on the surface just before Ursula grows past and towers the two. She then gains full control of the entire ocean, creating a storm with a maelstrom and shipwrecks — one of which Eric commandeers. As Ursula attempts to destroy a trapped Ariel in the maelstrom, Eric turns the wheel hard to port and runs Ursula through the abdomen with the ship's splintered bowsprit, mortally wounding her. After her death, Ursula's power breaks, causing Triton and all the other polyps in Ursula's garden to revert back into their original forms. Later, after seeing that Ariel truly loves Eric, Triton willingly changes her from a mermaid into a human. An unspecified amount of time later, Ariel and Eric have their wedding on a ship and depart.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>小美人鱼</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>原作: </span><a href=\"/person/2496\">Hans Christian Andersen</a></li><li><span>製作: </span><a href=\"/person/6816\">Walt Disney Pictures</a></li><li><span>动画制作: </span><a href=\"/person/13956\">Walt Disney Animation Studios</a></li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1989-11-14</li><li><span>片长: </span>85 minutes</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/littlemermaid/home.html</li><li><span>Copyright: </span>Walt Disney Pictures</li>","collection":{"wish":11,"collect":276,"on_hold":3,"dropped":6},"tags":[{"name":"童年","count":58},{"name":"欧美","count":58},{"name":"Disney","count":49},{"name":"剧场版","count":33},{"name":"迪士尼","count":32},{"name":"1989","count":30},{"name":"动画电影","count":19},{"name":"美国","count":12},{"name":"电影","count":10},{"name":"童话衍生","count":7},{"name":"映画","count":4},{"name":"1989年","count":4},{"name":"85~89年","count":3},{"name":"Silver_Screen_Partners_IV","count":2},{"name":"美国动画","count":2},{"name":"JohnMusker","count":2},{"name":"RonClements","count":2},{"name":"恋爱","count":2},{"name":"欧美动画","count":1},{"name":"公主系列","count":1},{"name":"美人鱼","count":1},{"name":"童话改","count":1},{"name":"1980s","count":1},{"name":"1989年11月","count":1},{"name":"Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios","count":1},{"name":"Musical","count":1},{"name":"ReneAuberjonois","count":1},{"name":"全","count":1},{"name":"Romance","count":1},{"name":"Christopher_Daniel_Barnes","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":859521,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/859521","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":2496,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/12/ff/2496_prsn_anidb.jpg","name":"汉斯·克里斯蒂安·安徒生","desc":"原作"},{"id":6816,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/4f/85/6816_prsn_MGpfY.jpg","name":"迪士尼电影公司","desc":"製作"},{"id":13956,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/9b/d2/13956_prsn_PJEz4.jpg","name":"华特·迪士尼动画工作室","desc":"动画制作"}],"relations":[{"id":183956,"image":"","title":"The Little Mermaid","type":"三次元","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/183956"},{"id":259636,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/30/bf/259636_236S4.jpg","title":"The Little Mermaid","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/259636"},{"id":112360,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b2/25/112360_gQ4gi.jpg","title":"The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/112360"},{"id":113260,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/1e/ab/113260_qQCAa.jpg","title":"The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/113260"},{"id":58994,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/20/dc/58994_iV7e8.jpg","title":"KINGDOM HEARTS -HD I.5 ReMIX-","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/58994"},{"id":706,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9c/82/706_8v8u0.jpg","title":"KINGDOM HEARTS: Chain of Memories","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/706"},{"id":39259,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/92/5d/39259_66W6r.jpg","title":"KINGDOM HEARTS II","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/39259"},{"id":85389,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/e6/32/85389_1N8mV.jpg","title":"KINGDOM HEARTS -HD II.5 ReMIX-","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/85389"},{"id":20992,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0b/02/20992_h5Hxh.jpg","title":"KINGDOM HEARTS","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/20992"},{"id":257923,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/d8/4d/257923_YnP6I.jpg","title":"KINGDOM HEARTS FINAL MIX","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/257923"},{"id":257925,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/35/25/257925_YU1hf.jpg","title":"KINGDOM HEARTS II FINAL MIX+","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/257925"},{"id":222542,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c2/71/222542_2ghbi.jpg","title":"KINGDOM HEARTS -HD I.5+II.5 ReMIX-","type":"游戏","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/222542"},{"id":216525,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3d/f9/216525_r2O8q.jpg","title":"Ralph Breaks the Internet","type":"角色出演","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/216525"},{"id":10654,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c3/70/10654_N85xk.jpg","title":"The Little Match Girl","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/10654"}],"like":[{"id":32248,"name":"百兽王","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/24/62/32248_XlRE7.jpg"},{"id":35632,"name":"小蝌蚪找妈妈","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/73/e9/35632_vuj2v.jpg"},{"id":36268,"name":"葫芦兄弟第二部","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/af/f7/36268_9z7M9.jpg"},{"id":22986,"name":"狮子王2：辛巴的荣耀","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f9/8a/22986_41MfM.jpg"},{"id":25713,"name":"大力水手","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/a3/90/25713_7HDKe.jpg"},{"id":25077,"name":"美女与野兽","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/4a/17/25077_nyGs9.jpg"},{"id":37396,"name":"西游记","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/af/b7/37396_fA8hd.jpg"},{"id":40190,"name":"冰川时代","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/cb/d3/40190_4Vy1o.jpg"}]}
