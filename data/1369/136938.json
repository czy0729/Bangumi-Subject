His first picture is the Garden of Eden. Once Eve becomes pregnant, all the tribulations of the real world are unleashed upon her. She follows through dream-like sequences populated with crying birds, brick-wall-faced bureaucrats and pensive philosophers in seemingly petrified poses. Irritated, repressed and allured by each other, the creatures on the screen start living a life of their own. Gradually, a dark climax builds up. Will the Artist himself be able to handle so much emotional intensity?","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>石头</li><li><span>别名: </span>{ Stones</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2001-02-12</li><li><span>片长: </span>9分钟</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>www.cakostudio.hu/</li><li><span>制片国家/地区: </span>匈牙利</li><li><span>语言: </span>无对白</li><li><span>导演: </span>Ferenc Cakó</li><li><span>编剧: </span>Ferenc Cakó</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":4,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"冷门","count":1},{"name":"短片","count":1}]}
