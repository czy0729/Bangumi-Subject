But unlike its protagonist, Cinders is not afraid of taking fate into her own hands. Even if it means breaking the rules.\r\n \r\nThe game takes a look at four women and what made them who they are. It’s a story about balancing freedom and dreams with circumstance and harsh reality. About growing up and finding out the true meaning of independence. Distancing itself from the judgmental simplicity of the original, Cinders tries to explore the more complex nature of oppression, responsibility and innocence.\r\n \r\nWith 120 decision points and over 300 options to choose from, Cinders gives you total control over the main character’s personality and how her story unfolds.","info":"<li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2012年6月20日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$19.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://moacube.com/games/cinders/</li>","collection":{"wish":3,"collect":2,"dropped":1}}
