Now it's an intergalactic competition, and of course you've entered the contest.\r\n\r\nThere are 170 levels and 4 difficulty settings, each of which must be cleared of all bricks in this shareware game in the vein of Arkanoid. You control a bat at the bottom of the screen, which must stop a ball as it comes towards you and direct in back up the screen, which is where the bricks which need destroying reside. Helping you out are bonus features including extra balls, bombs which clear all surrounding bricks, and fireballs to remove blocks quickly.","info":"<li><span>游戏类型: </span>STG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2001年11月</li><li><span>开发: </span>Reflexive Entertainment Inc.</li><li><span>发行: </span>Reflexive Entertainment Inc.</li>","collection":{"collect":1}}
