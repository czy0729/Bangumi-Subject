Based on the claim on her CV that she \"has a lot of experience with computers\", Denholm Reynholm (Christopher Morris) places her in charge of the IT department. She discovers to her dismay that her office is on the basement floor with \"standard nerds\" Roy (Chris O'Dowd) and Moss (Richard Ayoade). The two are resistant to her leadership, which is affirmed when they discover she knows very little about computers. However, Denholm's adversity to non-teamwork forces the trio to get along. Jen hosts a party to boost the department's popularity, but it backfires when Moss accidentally recalls an inappropriate story.","status":"Air"},{"id":40840,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/40840","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Calamity Jen","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2006-02-03","comment":1,"desc":"Denholm mandates his employees to attend a stress seminar, threatening to fire those who still experience stress by the end of the day.

Moss tries to make his own version, but when he leaves a soldering iron switched on, he starts a fire in the office.

Despite Roy's insistence that \"it's not shit\", he declares that the woman didn't like him because women only like \"bad boys\" and devises a plan to prove his theory by posting a despicable singles ad. After getting many responses, Roy arranges a date with a surprisingly good-looking woman and sets out to act like a \"bastard\" to progress their relationship. Jen has been impressing the temporary security guard with her fluke-knowledge of obscure facts and after he tells her he will call at a certain time, it is revealed that he has selected her as his \"phone a friend\" on the quiz show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. After being asked out on national television, Jen is presented with the real \"big question\", and things inevitably go awry. Moss suggests that Roy and Jen take their dates to a great restaurant called \"Messijo's\", but they fail to spot his mispronunciation and end up at \"Messy Joe's\", a popular family restaurant. After the ineptitude of both is exposed, Roy and Jen's dates leave together, and Roy ruins what could potentially have been a close moment between him and Jen.","status":"Air"},{"id":40842,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/40842","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"The Red Door","name_cn":"","duration":"25m","airdate":"2006-02-17","comment":1,"desc":"Frustrated at the repeated theft of his coffee mug, Moss shows off a plain-white one which supposedly has a picture of his head on the bottom; however, he is unable to find it. After heading upstairs to resolve an IT problem, Roy finds himself trapped underneath the desks of two female employees like a \"desk rabbit\". As Roy calls Moss away for help to escape, Jen investigates what's behind a strange red door in the department that Roy and Moss have forbidden her to open. Inside, she discovers Richmond (Noel Fielding), a lonely goth whose job is to watch over some blinky lights on a machine. Richmond shares his back story of how he was Denholm's right-hand man until the death of Denholm's father and (coincidentally) Richmond's discovery of the dark-wave band Cradle of Filth. Touched by his story, Jen sets out to help and restore Richmond to his former glory.","status":"Air"},{"id":40843,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/40843","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"The Haunting of Bill Crouse","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2006-02-24","comment":2,"desc":"After a terrible dinner date with co-worker Bill Crouse (Adam Buxton), Jen wants to avoid his asking for a follow-up date, so she tells Moss to lie and say that she is too busy. However, when Bill arrives and is about to uncover Moss's lie, Moss tells Bill that Jen has died. Things escalate when Bill spreads the rumour that he was the last person to sleep with Jen, while Moss lies to Jen that the flowers and sympathy card are because she was made Employee of the Month. When she starts reappearing in the office, Bill thinks she is haunting him, which is made worse when she later calls him and shows up at his house to take back the rumour. Meanwhile, Roy gets a request from a girl from the fifth floor (a place Roy calls \"The Land of the Beautiful People\"), but confuses the attractive Julie with the ugly Judy, the latter of whom made the request.","status":"Air"},{"id":40844,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/40844","type":0,"sort":6,"name":"Aunt Irma Visits","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"2006-03-03","comment":1,"desc":"Following a meeting in which Denholm thanks everyone involved in Project Icarus except for the IT department, Jen becomes exceptionally moody and irritable as if she were a demon. When Moss and Roy ask about it, Jen replies it's a visit from her Aunt Irma, a euphemism for her premenstrual syndrome. Moss has been having therapy sessions with an attractive company psychiatrist, but when the latter wants to halt the sessions, Moss gets angry and starts swearing. After being personally thanked by Denholm for his work, Roy experiences strong emotional feelings. The guys reason that the recent mood changes must be Aunt Irma, but Moss mistakenly shares this insight to the IT community and it goes viral, turning them into Internet celebrities and inciting Aunt Irma riots throughout the world. To settle their emotions, Jen, Moss and Roy have a \"girls' night out\" where they watch Steel Magnolias. They then go to the celebration party where they all get drunk and dance around, but wake up with some unexpected partners the next morning.","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":29238,"image":"","name":"格雷厄姆·莱恩汉","desc":"创意总监"},{"id":29239,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/b6/8a/29239_prsn_X0WK5.jpg","name":"克里斯·奥多德","desc":"主演"},{"id":29240,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/3d/1c/29240_prsn_Nf600.jpg","name":"理查德·艾欧阿德","desc":"主演"},{"id":29241,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/59/12/29241_prsn_cCNrE.jpg","name":"凯瑟琳·帕金森","desc":"主演"}],"relations":[{"id":6792,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5e/98/6792_mS71B.jpg","title":"The IT Crowd (Season 2)","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/6792"}],"like":[{"id":6792,"name":"IT狂人 第二季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5e/98/6792_mS71B.jpg"},{"id":6793,"name":"IT狂人 第三季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f5/e5/6793_21rMN.jpg"},{"id":6841,"name":"IT狂人 第四季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/95/59/6841_Dw2DZ.jpg"},{"id":12074,"name":"废柴联盟 第二季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/cf/51/27381_PPpnQ.jpg"},{"id":24175,"name":"唐顿庄园 第二季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/2a/3e/24175_7nMUI.jpg"},{"id":4592,"name":"布莱克书店 （第一季）","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/50/16/4592_bB2LY.jpg"},{"id":6014,"name":"废柴联盟 第一季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/3f/68/6014_d0SE5.jpg"},{"id":11820,"name":"唐顿庄园 第一季","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/c3/df/11820_chsSz.jpg"}]}
