Horatio spends his days studying the Book of Man, sparring with his droid companion Crispin, and tinkering with the airship they call home — a peaceful existence that becomes threatened when a rogue robot steals the energy source that the pair needs to survive.\r\n\r\nWhen Horatio and Crispin’s search for energy brings them to the dazzling city of Metropol, the simple quest to recover their stolen power core leads to unexpected discoveries about Horatio’s origins and a new understanding of the legendary humans who walked the earth before him.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Linux</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>IOS</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>AVG</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2012/12/5</li><li><span>售价: </span>$9.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.wadjeteyegames.com/games/primordia/</li>"}
