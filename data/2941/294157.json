Happily taking them in her arms, she tosses aside her old rag doll. That night, the girl dreams that the rag doll, abandoned on the floor, comes silently to life to entertain her. The rag doll dances across a piano and skates across a table. The new toys, also coming to life, join the antics. The rag doll, turning on an electric fan, is blown about and nearly knocks over a vase as it attempts to avoid falling off the table. The girl, getting out of bed, saves the vase and takes the doll in her arms. The girl wakes up to find her rag doll still on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe film was Karel Zeman's first experiment in combining stop-motion animation with live-action footage, a process he continued to explore in his later feature films, beginning with Journey to the Beginning of Time (1955) and The Fabulous World of Jules Verne (1958). The pioneering animator Hermína Týrlová also reportedly participated in the production.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the film was released by Universal-International in 1948. An abridgement of the American version for home projection was sold by Castle Films from 1949 through 1965. The American version replaces the wordless Czech soundtrack with new audio, including a voice for the rag doll; it also includes new footage in which Santa Claus, appearing by magic, sends the Christmas dream to the girl.","info":"<li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>1945</li><li><span>片长: </span>11 min</li><li><span>导演: </span>Kamel Zeman</li>","collection":{"wish":1,"collect":2},"eps":[{"id":915574,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/915574","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}]}
