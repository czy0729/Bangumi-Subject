{"id":294178,"type":4,"name":"EarthNight","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b4/ad/294178_9EQtN.jpg","summary":"Dragons have taken over the Earth, and humanity has fled to space. You must help Stanley and Sydney skydive back to Earth while careening across the backs of massive, snake-like dragons as they soar high above the planet, all while an original chiptune soundtrack pounds away in the background. Every moment is intense and layered with intricacy.\r\nWe intend to change the way you think about auto-runner games by designing on a much grander scale.  EarthNight is available on Apple Arcade and coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4 and Steam on Dec 3rd, 2019.
