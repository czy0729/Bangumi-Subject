Their hold on the territory is threatened by two near-simultaneous incidents. Patriarch Otto Gerhardt suffers a debilitating stroke, leaving the leadership of the dynasty uncertain, with his sons Dodd, Bear and Rye all seeking the position. Meanwhile Rye, the youngest son, attempts to blackmail a judge at a waffle house, only for the encounter to devolve into violence. Rye kills the judge, along with a cook and a waitress. Afterward, distracted by an apparent UFO sighting, Rye is struck by a passing car which drives off with him still stuck in the windshield. The driver, Peggy Blomquist, believes Rye is dead and keeps him in her garage without informing her husband Ed, a local butcher's assistant. After coming home, Ed discovers Rye still alive but manic, and stabs Rye to death after being attacked by him. Peggy convinces a traumatized Ed to keep the incident a secret, and they hide Rye's corpse in their meat freezer. Lou Solverson, the father of Molly Solverson from Season 1 (played by Keith Carradine), investigates the waffle house shooting, noting the strangeness of the shooter apparently fleeing in a vehicle after parking his own outside the diner. At home he deals with the progressing cancer of his wife Betsy, who has recently begun chemotherapy. Meanwhile, in light of Otto Gerhardt's stroke, the members of another crime syndicate decide to make a move on Sioux Falls.","status":"Air"},{"id":463315,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/463315","type":0,"sort":2,"name":"Before the Law","name_cn":"","duration":"00:58:20","airdate":"2015-10-19","comment":1,"desc":"Joe Bulo arrives at the Gerhardt farm, along with Mike Milligan and the Kitchen brothers. Bulo offers Floyd a buyout of the Gerhardt operation but still allows them to run it. After he leaves, Floyd tells her sons, minus the missing Rye, about the meeting. Dodd bristles at allowing Floyd to run the business, but she states that he can run it, once the current situation settles. She then demands for Rye to be found. Mike and the Kitchens also begin searching for Rye. Peggy resumes work at the beauty shop, while Ed stays home to clean up the garage and bundle up Rye's body to take to the butcher shop. While driving his family into town, Lou stops by the crime scene, where Betsy finds Rye's gun in some weeds. Later that night, Lou sees a light on inside the closed butcher shop to find Ed there. Lou asks for some bacon, while Ed does his best to distract him from seeing his task of putting Rye's body parts into a meat grinder.","status":"Air"},{"id":463316,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/463316","type":0,"sort":3,"name":"The Myth of Sisyphus","name_cn":"","duration":"00:46:18","airdate":"2015-10-26","comment":1,"desc":"After fingerprints are pulled from the gun at the waffle house, a manhunt begins for Rye Gerhardt. At the same time, Dodd and his henchman Ohanzee, as well as Mike Milligan, each conduct an independent search for him as well. While visiting the local hairdresser to put up a wanted picture of Rye, Hank encounters Betsy and they have an exchange in which she accurately speculates that Rye was the victim of a hit and run. Peggy overhears this and quickly convinces Ed to crash her car a second time, covering up the damage caused by the collision with Rye. Meanwhile, Lou visits the Gerhardt farm and has a tense encounter with the entire clan. He then visits Skip's typewriter store, after noticing a jumpy Skip at Judge Mundt's office earlier. There he encounters Mike Milligan and the Kitchen brothers, also searching for clues, which results in another standoff. Dodd's daughter Simone tips off Ohanzee as to a lead on Rye, and the two of them ambush Skip at Rye's apartment. They bring him to Dodd, who assaults Simone for acting independently before interrogating Skip, learning that he has no information on Rye's whereabouts. Ohanzee and Dodd force Skip into an open grave and bury him in hot asphalt.","status":"Air"},{"id":463317,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/463317","type":0,"sort":4,"name":"Fear and Trembling","name_cn":"","duration":"00:51:20","airdate":"2015-11-02","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"},{"id":463318,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/463318","type":0,"sort":5,"name":"The Gift of the Magi","name_cn":"","duration":"00:52:38","airdate":"2015-11-09","comment":3,"desc":"Lou is temporarily taken off the waffle house case while working a security detail for Ronald Reagan. Dodd and Hanzee manufacture a story about Ed being a hitman hired by Kansas City to kill Rye, hoping to spur Floyd to action. Floyd agrees to retaliate, and has a group of KC men ambushed by Hanzee and accomplices. Hanzee kills a Kitchen brother as well as Joe Bulo, and sends the latter's head to Mike Milligan. Mike threatens Simone during their next dalliance, demanding that she spy on her family for him. Meanwhile, Dodd sends his henchman Virgil to Luverne to kill Ed, and allows Bear's son Charlie to accompany him. In Luverne, Peggy takes Lou's warning to heart and plans to leave for California, but Ed insists on staying, as he is invested in his life there. Peggy nearly leaves without him, but has a change of heart and sells the car in order to pay for the butcher shop. Virgil and Charlie show up in town, and botch the attempt on Ed's life – Virgil is killed, Charlie is hospitalized, and the butcher shop goes up in flames.

Dodd and accomplices go to the Blumquist home hunting Ed, and Bear heads to the police station to fetch Charlie. Hanzee knocks out Hank, but Peggy subdues Dodd in her basement using his stun rod. When Ed demands a lawyer, Lou summons a drunken Karl Weathers, the only attorney in town, to the station. As Karl is leaving the station, Bear and his men arrive for Charlie. Knowing Ed would be shot on sight, Lou hatches a plan: Karl mediates with Bear, claiming that he is Charlie's lawyer and that Charlie, a minor will soon be released, which Karl claims is a better option than the Gerhardt's plan for bloodshed. Meanwhile, Lou sneaks Ed out a rear window, narrowly avoiding Hanzee. Bear and his men leave without incident. Hank, who has recovered enough to drive back to town, intercepts Lou and Ed, though Ed runs off, presumably to his house. Ed is followed shortly after by Hanzee. Simone had called Mike Milligan and revealed the Gerhardt's plan to kill Ed and retrieve Charlie. Tired of her father's abuse, she wants Mike to murder Dodd.

Ed and Peggy put Dodd into the trunk of his car, then drive to a relative's hunting cabin in Sioux Falls to hide out. They escape just before Lou and Hank arrive and discover the two dead Gerhardt men. Hanzee is following the Blumquists in short pursuit. At a gas station, Ed makes several unsuccessful phone calls to bargain Dodd's freedom with the Gerhardts, though none seem interested. He then calls Mike Milligan, offering him Dodd in exchange for being rid of the Gerhardts; they agree to meet the next day. Meanwhile, Dodd gets loose, incapacitates Peggy, and strings up Ed when he returns. Peggy revives and knocks Dodd unconscious in time to save Ed. While searching for leads on the Blumquist's whereabouts, Hanzee encounters several racist bar patrons who he shoots in the legs, after which he kills the bartender and two state police officers responding to the call, resulting in a manhunt for Hanzee. Following a clue from the Blumquist home, Hanzee finds Constance in her hotel room at the seminar. When Peggy calls, Hanzee forces Constance to prompt Peggy into revealing the Blumquists' location, but to little avail. However, he learns just enough to pinpoint their general whereabouts. He stops at the same gas station where Ed used the phone booth and coerces the attendant into revealing more information. Recognizing Hanzee from his mugshot in the newspaper, the attendant calls the police. Hanzee finds the cabin and holds Ed and Peggy at gunpoint before shooting Dodd in the head. Proclaiming he wants to be free of \"this life\", Hanzee asks Peggy to give him a professional haircut. Lou and Hank burst through the rear door and exchange gunfire with Hanzee as Peggy stabs him in the back with the scissors.

After recapturing Ed and Peggy Blumquist, Lou and Hank are forced to call in the South Dakota State Police, due to this being their jurisdiction. When Ed reveals his upcoming rendezvous with Mike Milligan in exchange for Dodd Gerhardt, State Police Captain Cheney hatches a ludicrous scheme to wiretap Ed and Peggy for the meeting, hoping to implicate Milligan and the Kansas City Mob. When Lou strongly opposes this scheme, Cheney has him escorted out of the state, though Hank stays behind. After Ed and Peggy agree to the plan, the police begin planning an ambush at the Motor Motel, only for Hanzee to spot and observe them. The narrator says that Hanzee betrays the Gerhardts for wholly unknown reasons. Hanzee lies to Floyd and Bear by claiming Dodd is still alive and inside the motel, and says that the Kansas City Mob is meeting at the motel. Meanwhile, Lou discovered the gas station attendant that Hanzee murdered. He goes back to warn the other police that Hanzee likely knows about their plan. At the same time, Lou is unaware that Betsy has fallen seriously ill back home. Lou arrives at the motel too late, as the Gerhardts have ambushed Cheney and the other officers, finding everyone dead except Hank and Ben Schmidt, who Peggy and Ed knocked out. Hanzee murders Floyd and the Gerhardt crew, then pursues the Blumquists. Bear witnesses this, but is shot and wounded by Lou, who Bear then attacks. In the midst of the madness, a UFO appears, hovering directly over the motel, distracting Bear and allowing Lou to kill him. Peggy and Ed wound Hanzee, then escape. Hank, shot by Hanzee, tells Lou to go after Hanzee and the Blumquists, as police reinforcements arrive at what becomes known as the \"Sioux Falls Massacre\".","status":"Air"},{"id":463323,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/463323","type":0,"sort":10,"name":"Palindrome","name_cn":"","duration":"00:51:28","airdate":"2015-12-14","comment":1,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"relations":[{"id":100402,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/0c/9d/100402_9fFHZ.jpg","title":"Fargo Season 1","type":"前传","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/100402"},{"id":158855,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/b1/ff/158855_MSBs8.jpg","title":"Fargo Season 3","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/158855"}]}
