It is produced by Spin Master Entertainment, with animation provided by Guru Studio. In Canada, the series is primarily broadcast on TVOntario, which first ran previews of the show in August 2013. The series premiered on Nickelodeon in the United States on August 12, 2013.\r\n\r\nThe series focuses on a young boy named Ryder who leads a crew of search and rescue dogs that call themselves the PAW Patrol. They work together on missions to protect the shoreside community of Adventure Bay. Each dog has a specific set of skills based on emergency services professions, such as a firefighter, a police officer, and an aviation pilot. They all reside in doghouses that transform into customized vehicles for their missions. They are also equipped with backpacks called \"pup packs\" that contain tools that relate to the pups' jobs.\r\n\r\nEach episode of PAW Patrol follows a similar pattern and features recurring topics. Episodes normally open with a scene depicting the dogs going about their everyday lives, often playing with dog toys or engaging in activities at the local playground. Ryder, a ten-year-old boy, is advised of a problem by receiving a call for help or by witnessing a situation himself. His most frequent caller is an accident-prone marine biologist named Cap'n Turbot, who knows much about Adventure Bay's wildlife. Ryder always alerts the dogs via their blinking pet tags. The team members report to their base, the Lookout, and enter its elevator. Marshall typically arrives last causing a humorous mishap that makes the other dogs laugh as the elevator rises. When they reach the top floor, they arrange themselves in a line. Chase announces that the team is ready for action as Ryder tells the pups what has happened. He chooses several members of the team, normally two first responders, to help solve whatever problem has emerged. They ride a slide down to their vehicles and complete their mission. When they have finished, Ryder says his catchphrase: \"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!\", and congratulates the pups.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>汪汪队立大功</li><li><span>话数: </span>26</li><li><span>放送开始: </span>2013年8月12日</li><li><span>放送星期: </span>星期一</li><li><span>动画制作: </span>Guru Studio、<a href=\"/person/14099\">Spin Master</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>狗狗巡逻队</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>パウ・パトロール</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://pawpatrol.com/</li><li><span>播放电视台: </span>TVOKids、Nickelodeon</li><li><span>其他电视台: </span>テレビ東京、テレビ愛知</li><li><span>播放结束: </span>2014年8月2日</li><li><span>Copyright: </span>© Spin Master Ltd.
