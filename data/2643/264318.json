The barkeep gets a patchy phone call. It's hard to tell what the caller is saying, but this much is clear: someone in The Six Pint Inn is planning a murder.\r\n\r\nThere are six patrons; all of them are video game protagonists trying to escape their past... But The Six Pint Inn has a way of bringing back old memories. Each flashback plays out in an entirely different genre, sometimes blending multiple. By exploring these memories you may discover the identity of the murderer... or you may learn much darker secrets.","info":"<li><span>平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2018年10月16日</li><li><span>售价: </span>$9.99</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>https://www.the-hex.com/</li>","collection":{"wish":4,"collect":16,"doing":2},"tags":[{"name":"meta","count":5},{"name":"2018","count":2},{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"DANIEL_MULLINS_GAMES","count":1},{"name":"独立游戏","count":1}]}
