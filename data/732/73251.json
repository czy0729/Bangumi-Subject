It’s been fun and educational putting this together, and I’m happy to make the full soundtrack available here, below, for free.\r\n\r\nI’m a big fan of movie music from the 80′s and 90′s – like John Williams (1993 was his most amazing year), Danny Elfman’s 90′s heyday, Vangelis in the early 80′s – all with strong melodic themes and instantly identifiable orchestration. It was my goal with this soundtrack to write music that sounded like it could have been written in that time of VHS tapes and Stan Winston special effects, with clear, hummable melodies for each character and theme.\r\n\r\nFor the curious musicians reading this, I used a music program called Reaper to create all of the music – a lightweight DAW that’s less than 8MB, fast, and well designed. Weirdly, though, it has no form of classic staff notation, which was disorienting at first, until I got used to clicking notes into a piano roll. Almost all instruments are from my collection of old SoundFont2 files, converted to SFZ format with sfZed, and played back with the free SFZ sampler. I also used a few instruments from the ambitious open source Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra.\r\n\r\nThanks, and enjoy the music!\r\nKyle (Gabler)","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>小小地狱火原声集</li><li><span>发售日期: </span>2012-12-13</li><li><span>价格: </span>Free</li><li><span>播放时长: </span>23分06秒</li><li><span>录音: </span>Kyle Gabler</li><li><span>碟片数量: </span>1</li><li><span>艺术家: </span>Kyle Gabler</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"KyleGabler","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":0,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/0","type":0,"sort":0,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":""}],"disc":[{"title":"Disc 1","disc":[{"title":"1 Little Inferno Titles","href":"/ep/270265"},{"title":"2 Miss Nancy Welcomes You","href":"/ep/270266"},{"title":"3 Your New Friend Sugar Plumps","href":"/ep/270267"},{"title":"4 Reporting From the Weather Balloon","href":"/ep/270268"},{"title":"5 Just Like You","href":"/ep/270269"},{"title":"6 8 Bit Inferno","href":"/ep/270270"},{"title":"7 Something to Tell You","href":"/ep/270271"},{"title":"8 Inferno Beta","href":"/ep/270272"},{"title":"9 Cardboard Sword","href":"/ep/270273"},{"title":"10 Up Up Up the Chimney","href":"/ep/270274"},{"title":"11 Incident on the Other Side of the Wall","href":"/ep/270275"},{"title":"12 Transhumanist Connects","href":"/ep/270276"},{"title":"13 Ooo It's so Bright!","href":"/ep/270277"},{"title":"14 The City","href":"/ep/270278"},{"title":"15 Gate Operator, Open the Gates!","href":"/ep/270279"},{"title":"16 Productivity Tango","href":"/ep/270280"},{"title":"17 Miss Nancy Remembers","href":"/ep/270281"},{"title":"18 The City Limits","href":"/ep/270282"},{"title":"19 Breaking Weather Report","href":"/ep/270283"},{"title":"20 Over the Smokestacks, Over the City","href":"/ep/270284"},{"title":"21 Little Inferno Just For Me","href":"/ep/270285"},{"title":"22 Tomorrow Corporation, the Future is Tomorrow!","href":"/ep/270286"}]}]}
