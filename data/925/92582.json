It simulates a large population of imperfectly replicating organisms, in an environment that offers a variety of food sources, and then allows darwinian evolution to take over from there.\r\n\r\nIt also provides you, the player, with tools to interact with and observe the simulation. You can help or harm particular pheneotypes, perform your own experiments on the populations, or just observe as the Tree of Life builds itself through genetic drift and natural selection.\"","info":"<li><span>别名: </span>Species ALRE</li><li><span>平台: </span>Windows</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>sandbox</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.speciesgame.com/</li>","collection":{"wish":1}}
