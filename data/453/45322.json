Perseus Mandate is a stand-alone expansion pack for the psychological survival horror first-person shooter video game F.E.A.R. The expansion was developed by TimeGate Studios, the same development team behind the first expansion, F.E.A.R. Extraction Point. It was ported to the Xbox 360 and released as part of the F.E.A.R. Files package in November 2007.\r\n\r\nThe game follows the exploits of a new player character, a member of a secondary F.E.A.R. team sent in to investigate Armacham's Perseus Project. The game takes place during the events of the original F.E.A.R. as well as the Extraction Point expansion pack. New introductions to gameplay include friendly A.I.-controlled characters who fight alongside the player character, as well as a new faction of enemies. The sequel to F.E.A.R., F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, ignores the events of both expansion packs.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>极度恐慌：帕尔修斯的指令</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/31207\">Sierra Entertainment</a></li><li><span>平台: </span>Xbox 360</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>PC</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>FPS</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Lithtech Jupiter EX</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>1人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2007年11月6日</li><li><span>开发: </span>TimeGate Studios</li>","collection":{"wish":2,"collect":14,"on_hold":2},"tags":[{"name":"FPS","count":6},{"name":"PC","count":2},{"name":"STEAM","count":2},{"name":"普通游戏","count":1},{"name":"2007","count":1},{"name":"资料片","count":1},{"name":"美国","count":1}],"staff":[{"id":31207,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/a6/cd/31207_prsn_v4z4M.jpg","name":"雪乐山公司","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":645,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/5e/9f/645_aus.jpg","title":"F.E.A.R.
