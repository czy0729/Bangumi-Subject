Instead, they got bullets, and Tom McKenna got to be an instant media celebrity. That got him a lot of attention from some people he thought he'd escaped long ago. The kind of people who never forget a face--even after twenty years...\r\n\r\nNow Tom must confront a group of cold-blooded mobsters intent on settling the score. As much as he tries to deny it, he's a man with a history of violence--and with the lives of his family hanging in the balance, he'll do anything to make sure his secret past stays buried...forever.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>暴力史</li><li><span>册数: </span>1</li><li><span>话数: </span>3</li><li><span>作者: </span>Vince Locke</li><li><span>作画: </span>John Wagner</li><li><span>出版社: </span>Paradox Press</li><li><span>发售日: </span>1997-02-01</li><li><span>页数: </span>286</li><li><span>ISBN: </span>9781563893674</li><li><span>语言: </span>英语</li>","collection":{"collect":1},"tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":1},{"name":"漫画","count":1}]}
