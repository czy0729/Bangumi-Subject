As time progresses Alice loses touch with reality. She is institutionalized in Rutledge Asylum, where she is observed and treated by Dr. Heironymous Wilson. Alice's only possession in Rutledge is a stuffed rabbit. Ten years after Alice was committed to Rutledge, she finds herself sucked back into a Wonderland that has been twisted by her own broken mind. The White Rabbit summons Alice to aid a radically altered Wonderland, which became a twisted version of itself as it came under the horrible rule of the Queen of Hearts. The Cheshire Cat serves as Alice's companion throughout the game, frequently appearing to guide her with cryptic comments.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>爱丽丝梦游魔境</li><li><span>发行: </span><a href=\"/person/13930\">Electronic Arts</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>アリスインナイトメア</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>愛麗絲驚魂記</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>恐怖的爱丽丝</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>愛麗絲夢游魔境</li><li><span>平台: </span>Microsoft Windows</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">平台: </span>Mac OS X</li><li><span>游戏类型: </span>恐怖 / 动作 / 平台 / 横向卷轴</li><li><span>游戏引擎: </span>Quake III Arena</li><li><span>游玩人数: </span>单人</li><li><span>发行日期: </span>2000-10-06</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.alicemadnessreturns.com/</li><li><span>开发: </span>Rogue Entertainment</li>","collection":{"on_hold":7,"dropped":6,"wish":45,"collect":48,"doing":3},"tags":[{"name":"PC","count":12},{"name":"麻辣马","count":4},{"name":"ACT","count":4},{"name":"解谜冒险","count":2},{"name":"AAVG","count":2},{"name":"AVG","count":2},{"name":"PS3","count":2},{"name":"考古","count":1},{"name":"次优先","count":1},{"name":"EA","count":1},{"name":"爱丽丝","count":1},{"name":"","count":""}],"staff":[{"id":13930,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/ed/80/13930_prsn_10ahO.jpg","name":"Electronic Arts","desc":"发行"}],"relations":[{"id":8108,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/25/b0/8108_tTLHn.jpg","title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","type":"书籍","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/8108"},{"id":37515,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/75/fc/37515_us.jpg","title":"American Mcgee's Alice (Score)","type":"原声集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/37515"},{"id":18693,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/9d/d3/18693_Ze00H.jpg","title":"Alice: Madness Returns","type":"续集","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/18693"}]}
