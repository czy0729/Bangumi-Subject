{"id":333343,"type":2,"name":"PONY METAL U-GAIM PROMOTION FILM","image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f9/2c/333343_q3a3i.jpg","summary":"Pony Metal U-GAIM is an anime that was never made. Only a promotional video of it exists.\r\n\r\nFrom what is known the story was supposed to be a crossover between Mahou no Tenshi Creamy Mami and Heavy Metal L-Gaim. The heroine, Morisawa Yuu, is killed in a car accident and brought back to life as a crime-fighting super robot.\r\n\r\nNote: What makes this pilot great is that it's 100% Anime R, and was produced by Anime R at the height of its powers, so it's packed full of Anime R goodness. Anime R's work is mostly buried in Sunrise robot shows from the 80s that don't get much play from fans anymore, so they've never received their due respect over here (though the same could be said for many great subcontractors of yore). This pilot offers a dense summation of what made Anime R great, so it's the perfect introduction to this studio.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php/pony-metal-u-gaim","info":"<li><span>上映年度: </span>1986</li>","relations":[{"id":10560,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/18/06/10560_Rivhz.jpg","title":"魔法の天使クリィミーマミ","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/10560"},{"id":37170,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/m/f5/cb/37170_lK6OC.jpg","title":"重戦機エルガイム","type":"其他","url":"https://bgm.tv/subject/37170"}]}
